Within Tailcall, `Context` is a pivotal component that allows for dynamic retrieval of values during the resolution of fields for a given type within the schema.

## Schema Definition

```typescript
type Context = {
  args: Map<string, JSON>
  value: JSON
  env: Map<string, string>
  vars: Map<string, string>
  headers: Map<string, string>
}
```

`Context` operates by storing values as key-value pairs, which can be accessed through mustache template syntax.

### args

This property facilitates access to query arguments. Consider the example:

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @http(path: "/users/{{.args.id}}")
}
```

Here, `args.id` is utilized to retrieve the `id` argument provided to the `user` query.

### value

This enables access to the fields of the specified type.

```graphql showlineNumbers
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  comments: [Comment]
    @http(path: "/posts/{{.value.id}}/comments")
}
```

In this case, `value.id` accesses the `id` field of the `Post` type.

### env

Environment variables, set at server startup, allow directives to dynamically adapt behavior based on external configurations without altering the server configuration itself.

Example:

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  users: [User]!
    @http(baseUrl: "{{.env.API_ENDPOINT}}", path: "/users")
}
```

`env.API_ENDPOINT` references an environment variable named `API_ENDPOINT`, which specifies the base URL for HTTP requests.

### vars

`vars` offers a mechanism for defining reusable variables within the configuration. Unlike `env`, these are embedded and can be universally applied across configurations.

```graphql showLineNumbers
schema
  @server(
    vars: {key: "apiKey", value: "{{.env.AUTH_TOKEN}}"}
  ) {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): [User]
    @http(
      url: "/users"
      headers: [
        {
          key: "Authorization"
          value: "Bearer {{.vars.apiKey}}"
        }
      ]
    )
}
```

Here, the variable `apiKey` is set using an environment variable and subsequently utilized in the `Authorization` header for HTTP requests.

### headers

Headers originate from the request made to the GraphQL server.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  commentsForUser: [Comment]
    @http(path: "/users/{{.headers.x-user-id}}/comments")
}
```

In this example, `headers.x-user-id` extracts the value of the `x-user-id` header present in the request, dynamically constructing the request path.
