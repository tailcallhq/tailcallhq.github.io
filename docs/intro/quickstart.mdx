If you're interested in exploring other installation methods, refer to our [installation
guide] for detailed instructions on other ways.

1. If you don't already have **brew** installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).
2. Add the Tailcall repository to Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```shell
   brew tap tailcallhq/tailcall
   brew install tailcall
   ```
3. Verify that Tailcall is installed correctly by running:
   ```shell
   tc
   ```

## Configuration

For our first example, we are going to compose a GraphQL schema from the REST APIs at <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com</a>, a free online REST API with some fake data.
We will use the API at `/users` to get a list of users, and `/users/:id/posts` to get the posts for each user, and compose them into a single GraphQL schema.

Create a file called `jsonplaceholder.graphql` and paste the following contents into it.

```graphql showLineNumbers
# Specify a base url for all http requests
schema @server(baseURL: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com") {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  # Specify the http path for the users query
  users: [User] @http(path: "/users")
}

# Create a user type with the fields returned by the users api
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  username: String!
  email: String!

  # Extend the user type with the posts field
  # Use the current user's id to construct the path
  posts: [Post] @http(path: "/users/{{value.id}}/posts")
}

# Create a post type with the fields returned by the posts api
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
```

The above file is a standard `.graphQL` file, with a few additions such as `@server` and `@http` directives. So basically we specify the GraphQL schema and how to resolve that GraphQL schema in the same file, without having to write any code! Here is a quick overview of what the above schema does:

## Launch

Now, run the following command to start the server with the full path to the `jsonplaceholder.graphql` file that you created above.

```shell
tc start ./jsonplaceholder.graphql
```

If the command succeeds, you should see output like the following below.

```shell
Endpoints:  2
Unsafe:     0
Playground: http://localhost/graphql
N + 1:      1
```

The server starts with the schema provided and prints out a load of meta information. We will cover those in detail in a bit. For now, open the **playground URL** in a new tab in your browser and try it out for yourself!

## Run

Let's try the following query, to get all the users and the title of each post of each user.

```graphql showLineNumbers
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

You should see output like the following:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Leanne Graham",
        "posts": [
          {
            "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit"
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Ervin Howell",
        "posts": [
          {
            "title": "et ea vero quia laudantium autem"
          },
          {
            "title": "in quibusdam tempore odit est dolorem"
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can now add additional fields, and compose more queries together!
