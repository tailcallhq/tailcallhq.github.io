Now, run the following command to start the server with the full path to the `jsonplaceholder.graphql` file that you created above.

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.graphql
```

If the command succeeds, you should see logs like the following below.

```bash
 🚀 Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000]
 🌍 Playground: http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

The server starts with the schema provided and prints out a load of meta information. We will cover those in detail in a bit. For now, open the **playground URL** in a new tab in your browser and try it out for yourself!
