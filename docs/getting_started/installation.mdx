  You can install the latest version -{" "}
  <b>

  </b>
  , by using
  <b> NPM</b>.
</>

## NPM

1. If you don't already have **nodejs** installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).
2. Install Tailcall by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm i -g @tailcallhq/tailcall
   ```
3. Verify that Tailcall is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   tc
   ```

   :::note
   Do not use the `--force` flag during npm installations, as it ignores installing platform-specific builds.
   :::

## Homebrew

1. If you don't already have Homebrew installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

2. Add the Tailcall repository to Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   brew tap tailcallhq/tailcall
   brew install tailcall
   ```
3. Verify that Tailcall is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   tc
   ```

4. Once installation is done, **upgrades** can be performed via:

   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade tailcall
   ```

## Curl

Follow the steps below to manually install the cli on your system:

<InstallCommand />

This command fetches and executes the Tailcall installation script. The installed files are located in the `~/.tailcall` directory.

Upon completion of the installation, extend your `PATH` environment variable to include the `~/.tailcall/bin` directory:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.tailcall/bin
```

## Docker

If you want to install Tailcall with Docker, follow the steps below. Before starting, ensure Docker is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

1. Pull the latest Tailcall Docker image using the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     docker pull ghcr.io/tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     <Version />
   </CodeBlock>

   This command fetches the latest version of the Tailcall Docker image from the Docker registry.

2. Run the Tailcall Docker container with the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     <Version />
   </CodeBlock>

   This command starts the Tailcall server in a Docker container. Similar to the homebrew installation, it exposes a the graphQL endpoint on port 8080.
