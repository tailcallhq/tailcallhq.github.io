# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to **Tailcall**! This document outlines the steps and guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository to your personal account on GitHub.
2. **Clone the Forked Repository:** Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tailcallhq/tailcall.git
   ```

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Rust:** If you haven't already, install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Install the `nightly` toolchain as well, as it's used for linting.
2. **Install Prettier:** Install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) too as this is also used for linting.
3. **Build the Application:** Navigate to the project directory and build the application.

   ```bash
   cd tailcall
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Start the Server:** To start the server, use the following command:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- start ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql
   ```
   Once the server is running, you can access the GraphiQL interface at [http://localhost:8000/graphiql](http://localhost:8000/graphiql).

## Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch:** Always create a new branch for your changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Write Clean Code:** Ensure your code is clean, readable, and well-commented.
3. **Follow Rust Best Practices:** Adhere to the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html).
4. **Use Title Case in Job Names:** When adding new CI jobs to `.github/workflows`, please use title case e.g. _Close Stale Issues and PR_.

## Testing

1. **Write Tests:** For every new feature or bugfix, ensure that you write appropriate tests.
   Structure your tests in the following way:

   ```rust
   use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
   fn test_something_important() {
      let value = setup_something_using_a_function();

      let actual = perform_some_operation_on_the_value(value);
      let expected = ExpectedValue {foo: 1, bar: 2};

      assert_eq!(actual, expected);
   }
   ```

   - Setup the value using helper methods in tests.
   - Create an actual and an expected value.
   - Assert the two values in a new line.
   - Ensure there is one assertion per test.

2. **Run Tests:** Before submitting a pull request, ensure all tests pass.
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Programming Style Guidelines

- When calling functions that do not need to modify values, pass references of those values.
- When calling functions that need to modify values, pass ownership of the values, and ensure they are returned from the function.

**IMPORTANT:** This programming style may not be suitable for performance-sensitive components or hot code paths. In such cases, prioritize efficiency and optimization strategies to enhance performance.

## Telemetry

Tailcall implements high observability standards that by following [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) specification. This implementation relies on the following crates:

- [rust-opentelemetry](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry/latest/opentelemetry/index.html) and related crates to implement support for collecting and exporting data
- [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html) and [tracing-opentelemetry](https://docs.rs/tracing-opentelemetry/latest/tracing_opentelemetry/index.html) to define logs and traces and thanks to integration with opentelemetry that data is automatically transferred to opentelemetry crates. Such a wrapper for telemetry allows to use well-defined library like tracing that works well for different cases and could be used as simple telemetry system for logging without involving opentelemetry if it's not required

When implementing any functionality that requires observability consider the following points:

- Add traces for significant amount of work that represents single operation. This will make it easier to investigate problems and slowdowns later.
- For naming spans refer to the [opentelemetry specs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#span) and make the name as specific as possible but without involving high cardinality for possible values.
- Due to limitations of tracing libraries, span names must be restricted to static strings. This constraint can be addressed by specifying an additional field with the special name `otel.name` (for details, refer to the `tracing-opentelemetry` docs).
- The naming of the attributes should follow the opentelemetry's [semantic convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/). Existing constants can be obtained with the [opentelemetry_semantic_conventions](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry-semantic-conventions/latest/opentelemetry_semantic_conventions/index.html) crate.

## Benchmarks Comparison

### Criterion Benchmarks

1. **Important:** Make sure all the commits are done.
2. **Install packages:** Install cargo-criterion rust-script.
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-criterion rust-script
   ```
3. **Comparing Benchmarks:**
   You need to follow the following steps to compare benchmarks between `main`(Baseline) and your branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   cargo criterion --message-format=json > main.json
   git checkout -
   cargo criterion --message-format=json > feature.json
   ./scripts/criterion_compare.rs base.json main.json table

   ```

4. **Check the Results:** If the benchmarks show more than 10% degradation, the script will exit with an error. Please check "benches/benchmark.md" file to identify the benchmarks that failed and investigate the code changes that might have caused the degradation.

## Documentation

1. **Update README:** If your changes necessitate a change in the way users interact with the application, update the README accordingly.
2. **Inline Documentation:** Add inline documentation to your code where necessary.

## Committing Your Changes

1. **Atomic Commits:** Make sure each commit is atomic (i.e., it does one thing). This makes it easier to review and revert if necessary.
2. **Commit Message Guidelines:** Write meaningful commit messages. Start with a short summary (50 chars max), followed by a blank line and then a detailed description if needed.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request:** Navigate to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request against the `main` or `develop` branch.
3. **Describe Your Changes:** In the pull request description, explain the changes you made, the issues they resolve, and any other relevant information.
4. **Wait for Review:** Maintainers will review your pull request. Address any comments or feedback they provide.

## Spread the Word

1. **Star the Repository:** If you find this project useful, please give it a star on GitHub. This helps increase its visibility and encourages more people to contribute.
2. **Tweet About Your Contribution:** Share your contributions and experiences with the wider community on Twitter. Use the hashtag `#TailcallContributor` and tag `@tailcallhq` to let us know!

## Community

1. **Be Respectful:** Please remember that this is an open-source project and the community is welcoming and respectful to all members.

## Final Words

Thank you for contributing! Your efforts help improve the application for everyone.
