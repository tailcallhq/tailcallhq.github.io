Hey there! We're thrilled that you're considering joining our Bounty Program. This is your chance to showcase your skills and get rewarded for them. Here's everything you need to know to dive in and make a splash.

## Our Philosophy

We’re all about meritocracy here. That means the best ideas and implementations win! We love seeing your quality work and fast moves. And yes, we recognize and appreciate your efforts when you exceed expectations.

## Quick & Quality

- **Speedy Gonzalez:** We like fast results! Quick feedback, quick updates. The faster, the better!
- **A+ Quality:** But hey, don’t rush it if it means cutting corners. We want your best – make it shine!

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

- **Join Us on Discord:** Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kRZBPpkgwq) server is THE place to collaborate, get tips, and find your next bestie. Let’s make magic together.
- **Share the Love:** Inspired by someone’s PR? Working together? Feel free to [/split](https://docs.algora.io/commands) that bounty – sharing is caring!

## How to Dive In

1. **Pick a Challenge:** Use `/attempt` in the comments to call dibs on an issue. It’s like saying “I got this!”
2. **Show Your Work:** Got an issue? Great! Now, whip up a draft PR within 24 hours to show you’re on it.
3. **Go for Gold:** Once you’re ready, switch that draft to Ready for Review. Make sure it’s polished and gleaming!
4. **Extra Mile Alert:** We’ve got bonuses for those who add that special touch. Clean up, optimize, or fix something extra? We’re here for it!

## The Rules of the Game

- **Be Quick or Be… Late:** No PR within 24 hours? Then it’s open season for that issue again.
- **There Can Be One Winner:** Multiple folks can try, but it's the top PR that emerges victorious. If there's a tie, the first submission takes the prize.
- **No Copycats:** Be original; be yourself. Avoid merely copying someone else's hard work.
- **Consider Before You Contribute:** If there’s already a PR in progress, perhaps take a moment to review it before submitting your own.

## Wrapping Up

We’re stoked to have you! This program is your chance to shine and get rewarded while at it. Stick to these friendly guidelines, and let’s make something awesome together. We look forward to seeing what you bring to the table.
