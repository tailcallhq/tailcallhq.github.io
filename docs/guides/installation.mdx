  You can install the latest version - <b> {github.release.tag_name}</b>, by using one of the following methods:
</>

## Homebrew

1. If you don't already have Homebrew installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

2. Add the Tailcall repository to Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```shell
   brew tap tailcallhq/tailcall
   brew install tailcall
   ```
3. Verify that Tailcall is installed correctly by running:

   ```shell
   tc
   ```

4. Once installation is done, **upgrades** can be performed via:

   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade tailcall
   ```

## Curl

Follow the steps below to manually install the cli on your system:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/install.sh | bash -s -- ${github.release.tag_name}`}
</CodeBlock>

This command fetches and executes the Tailcall installation script. The installed files are located in the `~/.tailcall` directory.

Upon completion of the installation, extend your `PATH` environment variable to include the `~/.tailcall/bin` directory:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.tailcall/bin
```

## Docker

If you want to install Tailcall with Docker, follow the steps below. Before starting, ensure Docker is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

1. Pull the latest Tailcall Docker image using the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">docker pull tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:{github.release.tag_name}</CodeBlock>

   This command fetches the latest version of the Tailcall Docker image from the Docker registry.

2. Run the Tailcall Docker container with the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     {github.release.tag_name}
   </CodeBlock>

   This command starts the Tailcall server in a Docker container. Similar to the homebrew installation, it exposes a the graphQL endpoint on port 8080.

## Verification

You should be now able to run the cli with the following commands:

```bash
tc
```

Checkout the documentation for **[tc]** for actual usage.

:::note
Once the installation is compeleted, you should verify the if the version printed on running `tc` command match the actual installed versions.
