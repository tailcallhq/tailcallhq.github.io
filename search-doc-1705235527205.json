These gateways handle tasks such as routing, authentication, circuit breaking, caching, logging, monitoring, protocol translation and the list doesn't end!  However, API Gateways don't provide developers access to the right abstraction when it comes to configuring these capabilities. Typically a TAG would provide you with primitives that are based on the underlying protocol ie. on which the API is served. For eg: You can perform authentication, routing, rate-limiting etc. on the bases of the request headers, url or method. All of which are components of the HTTP protocol. This happens because they treat the contents of request and response bodies as mere byte sequences, without delving into their substance.  Over the years, we have gotten used to consuming and managing APIs this way. Writing our own custom abstractions and sticking it around an existing over the shelf API Gateway. Our personal experience has been that nearly all companies after a certain scale require an abstraction that's specific to their business entities and feel restricted by what the API Gateway can provide.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Tailcall API Gateway​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Problem Statement","url":"/docs/#tailcall-api-gateway","content":" Based on our learnings of writing APIs at massive scale, we believe that the gateway should work around an enterprise's business entities and not the other way round. That's exactly what Tailcall helps you achieve. Tailcall provides first-class primitives designed to interact with your business entities directly without burdening the developer with the underlying protocol. This approach grants tremendous power and flexibility, transcending protocol constraints and focusing on the nature of the API's data. Let's take a the User entity as an example:  type User { id: ID name: String email: String account: Account } type Account { balance: Float lastUpdated: Date }   User is a business entity that can be resolved from multiple APIs. A /users API could resolve the id, name &amp; email and a /accounts/:userId could resolve the user's account balance and lastUpdated. With tailcall's API Gateway you will be able to specify just the account details as private and requiring authentication.  type User { id: ID name: String email: String account: Account @private } type Account { balance: Float lastUpdated: Date }   With Tailcall, specifying which parts of an entity should be public or private becomes straightforward, the platform also allows for the obfuscation of fields deemed sensitive or PII in specific contexts. This is all achievable through Tailcall's DSL, which facilitates all these complex operations efficiently and with minimal latency.  Further enhancing its capabilities, Tailcall's DSL supports sophisticated API Orchestration, going beyond mere request routing. It enables you to define the expected API structure and provides guidance on resolving each component within the entity type. For instance, consider a transaction API containing a userId. Traditionally, expanding this userId to retrieve the corresponding user details would require additional micro-services. However, with Tailcall, expressing this requirement through its DSL prompts the Tailcall runtime to automatically resolve and populate these details for you. This approach eliminates the need for any manual coding, streamlining the API management process significantly.

This process adds latency and increase in system resources . Limited Ports on Client Side: Each TCP connection from a client requires a unique combination of an IP address and a port number. With each new connection the IP remains the same because the client is the same, however a new port is used. The number of available ports on a machine is 65535, they are shared between all the processes and not all are available for usage. So this excessive creation of new connections ultimately leads to port exhaustion on the client side, preventing it from establishing new connections and causing system failures across the processes that are running on the system. tip You can check out the ports to process mapping using lsof and netstat commands.  Connection pooling helps mitigate the above issues by reusing existing connections for multiple requests. This reduces the frequency of connection establishments (and thus the handshake overhead) and also conserves client-side ports. This approach enhances application performance by minimizing the resources and time spent on managing connections.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Tuning HTTP Client​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Client for Performance","url":"/docs/guides/client-tuning/#tuning-http-client","content":" Tailcall by default uses connection pooling to manage connections and is setup with a default tuning which works well for most of the use cases. However, there are some cases where you might want to tune the HTTP client further to improve the performance of your application. Tailcall DSL provides an operator named @upstream which can help you to tune the HTTP client.  note The connection pooling is only a meaning optimization when it comes to HTTP/1. Since HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support multiplexing it's hard to see any observable difference in performance with pooling enabled.  When using HTTP/1.x, you can tune the connection pool by using the following parameters:  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"poolMaxIdlePerHost​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Client for Performance","url":"/docs/guides/client-tuning/#poolmaxidleperhost","content":" poolMaxIdlePerHost is a setting that specifies the maximum number of idle connections allowed per host and defaults to 60. Example:  schema @upstream( poolMaxIdlePerHost: 60 ) { query: Query }   Keeping too many idle connections can unnecessarily tie up memory and ports, while too few might lead to delays as new connections have to be established frequently. By limiting the number of idle connections, poolMaxIdlePerHost ensures that the system uses network and memory resources judiciously, avoiding wastage on connections that are rarely used.  If you have an application which connects to many hosts you should set this value to a lower number that way you will have connections available to connect to other hosts. On the other hand if you a few hosts and all requests have to be resolved by those hosts, you should keep a higher value for this setting.

It periodically sends packets to the server to check if the connection is still open and functioning. In connection pooling, where you have a set of reusable connections, tcpKeepAlive helps in maintaining these connections in a ready-to-use state. It's particularly useful for long-lived connections in the pool. By ensuring these connections are still active, it prevents the client from attempting to use a connection that has been closed by the server due to inactivity. Without tcpKeepAlive, idle connections in the pool might get silently dropped by the server or intermediate network devices (like firewalls or load balancers). When your client tries to use such a dropped connection, it would fail, causing delays and errors. Keeping connections alive and monitored means you can efficiently reuse them, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections frequently.

When you make a connection request client tries to resolve the DNS, have SSL handshake, and establish a TCP connection. In an environment where these pods are frequently created and destroyed, it's important to have a low connectTimeout to avoid unnecessary delays. In a system using connection pooling, If a connection can't be established within the connectTimeout period, the attempt is aborted. This prevents the client from waiting indefinitely for a connection to be established, which could lead to delays and timeouts.  Tailcall provides a parameter named connectTimeout which can be used to set the connection timeout in seconds for the HTTP client which defaults to 60 seconds. Example:  schema @upstream( connectTimeout: 10 ) { query: Query }   In summary, the key to maximizing HTTP client performance lies in understanding the underlying protocols and thoughtful configuration of client settings through test.

The schema after this transformation looks like this: type User { id: Int name: String } type Post { userName: String userId: Int! } So, we've used composition of operators to take a complex object (the User inside the Post), extract a specific part of it (name), name that part (userName), and then instruct GraphQL how to fetch the data using an HTTP request. info It is important to note that the order of the operators @modify and @http doesn't matter.

Therefore, for proper functioning, our code needs to access these values correctly.  Consider a simple scenario of JWT authentication. Typically, when signing tokens for our users, we need the following configuration set:  Expiry time: The duration after which the token expires.Secret key: The key used to encrypt the token.Issuer: The name of the token issuer, usually the organization's name.  There are broadly two ways to manage this:  Hardcode the values in our code: This is the simplest but most dangerous and inefficient approach. Hardcoding values in your codebase exposes sensitive information to everyone who works on the code, posing a massive security risk. Also, changing these values requires code modification and application redeployment, which is not ideal. Store the values in environment variables: This is the preferred approach. Store sensitive values in the OS of the server running your application. During runtime, your application can access these values from the OS. All programming languages have excellent support for this. This method keeps sensitive information secure and allows value changes without code modifications.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Environment Variables in Tailcall​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Environment Variables","url":"/docs/guides/environment-variables/#environment-variables-in-tailcall","content":" With Tailcall, you can seamlessly integrate environment variables into your GraphQL schema. Tailcall supports this through a env Context variable. This Context is shared across all operators, allowing you to resolve values in your schema.  Let's take an example. Consider the following schema:  type Query { users: [User]! @http(baseUrl: &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot;, path: &quot;/users&quot;) }   Here, we fetch a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API. The users field will contain the fetched value at runtime. This works fine, but what if we want to change the API endpoint? We would need to modify the code and redeploy the application, which is cumbersome.  We can address this issue using environment variables. Simply replace the API endpoint with an environment variable, allowing us to change the variable's value without altering our codebase.  type Query { users: [User]! @http(baseUrl: &quot;{{env.API_ENDPOINT}}&quot;, path: &quot;/users&quot;) }   Here, API_ENDPOINT is an environment variable that must be set on the device where your server runs. The server picks up this value at startup and makes it available in the env Context variable.  This approach allows us to change the API endpoint without modifying our codebase. For instance, we might use different API endpoints for development (stage-api.example.com) and production (api.example.com) environments.  Note that environment variables are not limited to the baseUrl or @http operator. Since evaluation is done via a Mustache template, you can use them anywhere in your schema.  Here's another example, using an environment variable in the headers of @grpc:  type Query { users: [User] @grpc( service: &quot;UserService&quot; method: &quot;ListUsers&quot; protoPath: &quot;./proto/user_service.proto&quot; baseURL: &quot;https://grpc-server.example.com&quot; headers: [{key: &quot;X-API-KEY&quot;, value: &quot;{{env.API_KEY}}&quot;}] ) }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Security Aspects and Best Practices​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Environment Variables","url":"/docs/guides/environment-variables/#security-aspects-and-best-practices","content":" Environment variables help mitigate many security risks. However, it's important to note that they don't eliminate risks entirely, as the values are still in plain text. While configuration values might not be highly sensitive, secrets can still be compromised.  To ensure your secrets remain secure, consider the following tips:  Use a .env file: A common practice is to create a .env file in your project's root directory to store all environment variables. This file should not be committed to your version control system and should be added to .gitignore. This approach ensures your secrets are not publicly exposed. Additionally, use a .env.example file to list all required environment variables for your application, informing other developers of the necessary variables. In Tailcall (or elsewhere), you can use this .env file by exporting its key-value pairs to your OS. For example, if your .env file looks like this: API_ENDPOINT=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com Export it to your OS with: export $(cat .env | xargs) On Windows, use: Get-Content .env | Foreach-Object { [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($_.Split(&quot;=&quot;)[0], $_.Split(&quot;=&quot;)[1], &quot;User&quot;) } After this, you can access API_ENDPOINT in your codebase. Use Kubernetes Secrets: If deploying your application with Kubernetes, use its Secrets feature to store environment variables. This ensures your secrets are not publicly exposed and are not hardcoded in your codebase. It also simplifies value changes when needed. Store Secrets Through Cloud Provider GUIs: When using a cloud provider for deployment, utilize their GUI to store environment variables. These interfaces are usually intuitive and practical, especially for containerized applications that scale automatically.

It works by modifying the schema and the data transformation process, simplifying how nested data is accessed and presented. For instance, consider a schema: schema { query: Query } type User @addField(name: &quot;street&quot;, path: [&quot;address&quot;, &quot;street&quot;]) { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! phone: String website: String address: Address @modify(omit: true) } type Address { street: String! city: String! state: String! } type Query { user(id: Int!): User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{args.id}}&quot;) } Suppose we are only interested in the street field in Address. The @addField operator above, applied to the User type in this case, creates a field called street in the User type. It includes a path argument, indicating the chain of fields to be traversed from a declared field (address in this case), to the field within Address to be added. We can also add a @modify(omit: true) to omit the address field from the schema, since we have already made its street field available on the User type. Post application, the schema becomes: schema { query: Query } type User { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! phone: String website: String street: String } type Query { user(id: Int): Post! } In the above example, since we added a @modify(omit: true) on the address field, the Address type is eliminated from the schema. The @addField operator also take cares of nullablity of the fields. If any of the fields in the path is nullable, the resulting type will be nullable. Additionally, @addField supports indexing, meaning you can specify the array index to be inlined. If a field posts is of type [Post], and you want to, for example, get the title of the first post, you can specify the path as [&quot;posts&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;]. type User @addField(name: &quot;firstPostTitle&quot;, path: [&quot;posts&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;title&quot;]) { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! phone: String website: String posts: Post @http(path: &quot;/users/{{value.id}}/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: Int! userId: Int! title: String! body: String! } In conclusion, the @addField operator helps tidy up your schema and streamline data fetching by reducing query depth, promoting better performance and simplicity.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"@modify","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/operators/modify/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"name​","type":1,"pageTitle":"@modify","url":"/docs/operators/modify/#name","content":" You can rename a field or a node in your GraphQL schema using the name argument in the @modify operator.
