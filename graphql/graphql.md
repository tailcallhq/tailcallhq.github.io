## Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL, developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries.
It was originally developed to simplify endpoint management for REST-based APIs. Instead of maintaining multiple endpoints with small amounts of disjointed data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint that inputs complex queries and outputs only as much information as is needed for the query.
This flexibility empowers developers to design more efficient and adaptable APIs, making GraphQL increasingly popular in modern web development.

At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching, where clients specify the exact structure of the data they require, and the server responds with precisely that data. This contrasts with REST APIs, where endpoints are predefined, and clients receive fixed responses regardless of their specific data needs.

To know more in detail about GraphQL, you can refer [What is GraphQL](what-is-graphql.md).

## Fundamental Concepts of GraphQL Server

GraphQL is built upon several core concepts that form the foundation of its query language and API design. Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively utilizing GraphQL in your projects.

### 1. Schema

At the heart of every GraphQL API is the schema which is a set of types which completely describe the set of possible data you can query on that server. Then, when queries come in, they are validated and executed against that schema.

GraphQL schemas are typically defined using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), a simple syntax for describing types. Each type in the schema represents a distinct object in the API. Types can have fields that correspond to the properties of the object, as well as relationships to other types.

Here's a code snippet illustrating how a GraphQL schema might be defined using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL):

```graphql
schema {
  query: Query
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  userId: ID!
}

type Query {
  post(id: ID!): Post
}
```

In this schema:

- We define an object type: `Post`.
- Each `Post` object has fields for `id`, `title`, `content`, and a `userId`.
- We also define a root `Query` type, which contains entry points for querying individual users and posts by their IDs. We will dig deep into this in [Next Section](#2-query)

This schema serves as a contract between the client and the server, defining the structure of the data available through the API and specifying how clients can interact with it. It forms the foundation for building and querying data in a GraphQL API.
You can learn more about [GraphQL Schema](schema-and-types.md) in detail.

### 2. Query

Most types in your schema will just be normal object types, but there are two types that are special within a schema Query and [Mutation](/graphql/#3-mutation).

Every GraphQL server has a query type and may or may not have a mutation type. These types are the same as a regular object type, but they are special because they define the entry point of every GraphQL query. So if you see a query that looks like:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
  }
}
```

That means that the GraphQL service needs to have a Query type with `user` field:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

### 3. Mutation

`Mutation` work in a similar way as [Query](#2-query) - you define fields on the Mutation type, and those are available as the root mutation fields you can call in your query.

It’s important to remember that other than the special status of being the “entry point” into the schema, the Query and Mutation types are the same as any other GraphQL object type, and their fields work exactly the same way.
While queries are used for reading data from a GraphQL API, mutations are used for modifying or updating data. Mutations allow clients to perform actions such as creating, updating, or deleting objects in the API's data store.

Here's a code snippet illustrating how mutations might be defined in GraphQL:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): User!
}
```

To query above mutation, you would use a query like this:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    input: {name: "Alice", email: "dummy@gmail.com"}
  ) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### 4. Subscriptions

Subscriptions enable real-time communication between clients and servers in GraphQL APIs. Unlike queries and mutations, which are request-response interactions, subscriptions establish a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing the server to push updates to the client as they occur.

Subscriptions are defined in the GraphQL schema alongside queries and mutations, specifying the events or data changes that clients can subscribe to. Clients initiate a subscription by sending a subscription query to the server, which then notifies the client whenever the subscribed event occurs.

Here's a code snippet illustrating how subscriptions might be defined in GraphQL:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  newMessage: Message!
}

type Message {
  id: ID!
  content: String!
  createdAt: String!
}

input SendMessageInput {
  content: String!
}

type Mutation {
  sendMessage(input: SendMessageInput!): Message!
}
```

In this schema:

- We define a `Subscription` type, which contains an entry point `newMessage` representing the event that clients can subscribe to receive updates about new messages.
- The `newMessage` subscription returns a `Message` object whenever a new message is created.
- We define a `Message` type with fields for `id`, `content`, and `createdAt`, representing a message object.
- We also define an input object type `SendMessageInput` with a field for `content`, which represents the input data for creating a new message.
- Finally, we have a `Mutation` type with an operation `sendMessage` that takes an input object of type `SendMessageInput` and returns the created `Message` object.

Clients can subscribe to the `newMessage` event to receive real-time updates whenever a new message is created. When a new message is created, the server pushes the updated message data to all subscribed clients in real-time.

In summary, the fundamental concepts of GraphQL—schema, queries, mutations, and subscriptions—provide a powerful framework for building flexible and efficient APIs that meet the diverse needs of modern applications.

This GraphQL configuration is enough for starting a GraphQL server using Tailcall. You can start the server using the [`start`](/docs/tailcall-graphql-cli/#start) command.

## Advantages of Using GraphQL

While REST (Representational State Transfer) has long been a dominant paradigm for building web APIs, GraphQL offers several key advantages that revolutionize API design and development:

### 1. Efficient Data Fetching

One of the primary advantages of GraphQL is its ability to efficiently fetch data from the server. With GraphQL, clients can request only the specific fields they need, avoiding the problem of over-fetching data that often occurs with REST APIs. This minimizes the amount of data transferred over the network, leading to faster response times and improved performance for client applications.

Additionally, GraphQL enables clients to retrieve related pieces of data in a single request by specifying nested query structures. This eliminates the need for multiple round-trip requests to fetch data from different endpoints, further optimizing data fetching efficiency.

### 2. Strongly-Typed Schema

GraphQL employs a strongly-typed schema to define the structure of the API and the types of data it supports. This schema serves as a contract between the client and the server, providing clear documentation of the available data and operations.

By defining a schema upfront, GraphQL enables type checking and validation of queries at compile-time, catching errors early in the development process. This helps prevent runtime errors and improves the reliability of client-server interactions.

Additionally, the schema serves as a central source of truth for the API, making it easier for frontend and backend developers to collaborate. Changes to the schema can be communicated effectively, and tools can be built around the schema to provide features like autocomplete and code generation.

### 3. Reduced Network Requests

GraphQL reduces the number of network requests required to fetch data by allowing clients to specify complex queries in a single request. Unlike REST APIs, which often require multiple requests to retrieve related data from different endpoints, GraphQL enables clients to fetch all the necessary data in a single round trip.

This reduction in network requests can have significant performance benefits, particularly for mobile and web applications operating over limited bandwidth or high-latency networks. By minimizing the overhead associated with network communication, GraphQL helps improve the responsiveness and efficiency of client applications.

In summary, GraphQL represents a paradigm shift in API design, offering developers greater flexibility, efficiency, and control over data fetching compared to traditional RESTful architectures. By leveraging the advantages of GraphQL—efficient data fetching, strongly-typed schema, and reduced network requests—developers can create more scalable, flexible, and performant systems that meet the needs of modern applications and users.

## Getting Started with GraphQL

Before diving into GraphQL development, it's essential to understand the basic steps involved in setting up a GraphQL server, defining a schema, and creating resolvers.

### 1. Setting up a GraphQL Server

Setting up a GraphQL server involves configuring a server environment capable of processing GraphQL requests and responses.
You can set up a GraphQL Server using Tailcall by following the steps below:

1. Install Tailcall's GraphQL CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @tailcallhq/tailcall
```

2. Set up a new GraphQL project by running the following command on a new project directory:

```bash
tailcall init
```

Using Tailcall's GraphQL CLI, you can quickly set up a GraphQL server with minimal configuration. The CLI provides a streamlined development environment for building GraphQL APIs.

### 2. Defining a Schema

The schema is a critical component of any GraphQL API, as it defines the types of data that clients can query and manipulate. GraphQL schemas are typically written using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), a simple syntax for describing types, fields, and relationships.

To define a schema, you'll need to specify the types of data available in your API, including objects, along with their associated fields and relationships. You'll also define query, mutation, and subscription types to specify the operations that clients can perform. for example:

```graphql
schema {
  query: Query
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type Query {
  post(id: ID!): Post
}
```

### 3. Attaching Resolvers

Resolvers are responsible for fetching the data requested by clients and returning it in the appropriate format. Each field in your schema corresponds to a resolver function, which retrieves the data from your data sources, such as databases, APIs, or in-memory caches.

When a client sends a GraphQL query, the server resolves each field in the query by executing the corresponding resolver function. Resolvers may perform database queries, call external APIs, or perform other tasks to retrieve the requested data. Once the data is fetched, the resolvers return it to the client in the format specified by the GraphQL schema.

By setting up a GraphQL server, defining a schema, and attaching resolvers, you can begin building powerful and flexible APIs that provide clients with the precise data they need. This foundational knowledge forms the basis for more advanced GraphQL development, including integrating GraphQL with existing APIs, handling complex data relationships, and optimizing API performance.

Lets attach resolvers to the schema we defined in the previous section using Tailcall's GraphQL Configuration:
We will add the resolvers with [`@http`](/docs/tailcall-dsl-graphql-custom-directives/#http-directive) directive:

```graphql
schema
  # highlight-start
  @upstream(
    baseURL: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
  ) {
  # highlight-end
  query: Query
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type Query {
  # highlight-start
  post(id: ID!): Post @http(path: "/posts/{{.args.id}}")
  # highlight-end
}
```

In this example:
We have used the `@http` directive to attach resolvers to the `post` field in the `Query`.
and `@upstream` directive to define the base URL for the upstream server.

This configuration is enough for starting a GraphQL server using Tailcall. You can start the server using the [`start`](/docs/tailcall-graphql-cli/#start) command.

For starting the server, you can use the following command:

```bash
tailcall start path/to/your-graphql-configuration
```

### 4. Handling Data Relationships

One of the strengths of GraphQL is its ability to handle data relationships with ease. When designing your GraphQL schema, consider how different types of data relate to each other and how clients may want to query or manipulate these relationships.

Use GraphQL's powerful type system to define clear relationships between your data types, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. This allows clients to fetch related data in a single query, reducing the need for multiple round-trip requests.

Here's a code snippet illustrating how to handle data relationships in GraphQL:

```graphql
schema
  @upstream(
    baseURL: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
  ) {
  query: Query
}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  userId: ID!
  # highlight-start
  author: User! @http(path: "/users/{{.value.userId}}")
  # highlight-end
}

type Query {
  post(id: ID!): Post! @http(path: "/posts/{{.args.id}}")
}
```

In this example:

- We define a `User` type representing a user object with fields for `id`, `name`, and `email`.
- We define a `Post` type representing a post object with fields for `id`, `title`, `content`, and `userId`.
- We establish a relationship between `Post` and `User` by adding an `author` field to the `Post` type. The `author` field fetches the user data corresponding to the `userId` of the post.
- We attach resolvers to the `author` field using the `@http` directive to fetch user data from the upstream server.
