# Place to Submit Outlines for the Blog Ideas

This folder is dedicated to collecting and organizing outlines for blog posts. If you have a great idea for a blog post and want to contribute, follow the guidelines below.

## How to Submit an Outline

### Step-by-Step Submission Guide

1. **Fork this Repository**

- Go to the [repository page](https://github.com/tailcallhq/tailcallhq.github.io) and click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page.
- This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**

- Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the forked repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/tailcallhq.github.io.git
  ```
- Navigate to the cloned repository:
  ```sh
  cd tailcallhq.github.io
  ```

3. **Create a New File for Your Outline**

- Navigate to the `outlines` directory:
  ```sh
  cd outlines
  ```
- Create a new markdown file with the name of your blog post. For example, if you want to write a blog post on "What is GraphQL?", create a file named `what-is-graphql.md`.
  ```sh
  touch what-is-graphql.md
  ```

4. **Add the Outline in Markdown Format**

- Open the newly created file in your preferred text editor.
- Add the outline for your blog post. Follow the structure provided in the next section.

5. **Commit Your Changes**

  git add outlines/what-is-graphql.md
  ```
- Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Add outline for blog post: What is GraphQL?"
  ```

6. **Push Changes to Your Fork**

- Push the committed changes to your forked repository:
  ```sh
  git push origin develop
  ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request**

- Go to the original repository page.
- Click on the "Pull Requests" tab and then click on the "New Pull Request" button.
- Select your forked repository and branch, and compare it with the base repository.
- Ensure your changes are displayed correctly and then click "Create Pull Request".
- Use the title of your blog post as the title of the pull request and provide a brief description of the outline.

## What Should the Outline Include?

### Outline Structure

1. **Title of the Blog Post**

- Provide a clear and concise title that summarizes the main topic of your blog post.

2. **Brief Description**

- Write a brief description (2-3 sentences) of what the blog post will cover and what the reader will learn from it.

3. **Headings and Subheadings**

- Organize your blog post with appropriate headings and subheadings. This helps to structure the content logically.
- Use markdown syntax for headings and subheadings:

  ```markdown
  # Main Heading

  ## Subheading

  ### Sub-subheading
  ```

4. **Images and Diagrams**

- If you plan to include images or diagrams, provide a brief description of each one.
- You can use placeholder text to indicate where the images will be placed:
  ```markdown
  ![Description of the image](image-url)
  ```

5. **Code Snippets**

- If your blog post should include code snippets, provide placeholders for them.
- Use triple backticks for code blocks:

  ````markdown
  ```language
  // Your code here
  ```
  ````

  ```

  ```
