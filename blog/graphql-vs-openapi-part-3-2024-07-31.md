   ```graphql
   subscription {
     stockPriceUpdate(symbol: "AAPL") {
       price
       change
       lastUpdated
     }
   }
   ```

   This setup is more efficient than repeatedly polling an endpoint, as it reduces unnecessary network traffic and server load. Combining subscriptions with queries and mutations allows for a seamless user experience, integrating real-time data updates with other operations within the same endpoint.
