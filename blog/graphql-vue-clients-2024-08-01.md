Ready to elevate your Vue development experience? Let's dive in!

## 🛠️ Project Setup

Let's start by setting up our Vue project with Vite, which provides a faster and leaner development experience:

```bash
npm create vite@latest vue-graphql-tailcall-showcase -- --template vue-ts
cd vue-graphql-tailcall-showcase
npm install
```

This creates a new Vue 3 project with TypeScript support. Now, let's install the necessary dependencies for our GraphQL experiments:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client @vue/apollo-composable graphql
npm install @urql/vue
npm install axios
npm install villus
```

These installations will allow us to explore different GraphQL client options in our Vue application.

### 🔧 Tailcall Backend Configuration

Now, let's set up our Tailcall backend that will wrap the JSONPlaceholder API, providing a GraphQL interface to RESTful data.

First, create a `tailcall` directory in the project root:

```bash
mkdir tailcall
```

Then, create a `jsonplaceholder.graphql` file in this directory:

```graphql
# File: tailcall/jsonplaceholder.graphql

schema
  @server(port: 8000, hostname: "0.0.0.0")
  @upstream(
    baseURL: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
    httpCache: 42
  ) {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post] @http(path: "/posts")
  user(id: Int!): User @http(path: "/users/{{.args.id}}")
}

type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  phone: String
  website: String
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  userId: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  user: User @http(path: "/users/{{.value.userId}}")
}
```

This GraphQL schema defines our API structure, mapping RESTful endpoints to GraphQL types and queries.

To start the Tailcall server, you'll need to have Tailcall installed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the installation instructions from the Tailcall documentation. Once installed, you can start the server with:

```sh
tailcall start ./tailcall/jsonplaceholder.graphql
```

This command starts a GraphQL server on `http://localhost:8000`, which will act as a bridge between our Vue application and the JSONPlaceholder API.

With this setup, we're ready to dive into the exciting world of GraphQL in Vue! 🚀 Our Tailcall backend provides a perfect playground for exploring different GraphQL client approaches, allowing us to fetch posts and user data with the flexibility and power of GraphQL queries. In the following sections, we'll explore how to leverage this backend with various GraphQL clients in our Vue application. Get ready for some data-fetching magic! ✨

Alright, let's dive into our first approach: Apollo Client! 🚀

## Apollo Client - The Swiss Army Knife of GraphQL

Apollo Client stands out in the GraphQL ecosystem due to its comprehensive feature set, including intelligent caching, real-time updates, and optimistic UI rendering. For Vue developers working on data-intensive applications, Apollo Client provides a sophisticated approach to state management and data fetching.

### 1. Setting Up Apollo Client in a Vue.js Project

Begin by installing the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client @vue/apollo-composable graphql
```

#### Configuration

Set up Apollo Client in your Vue application:

```typescript
// src/apollo.ts
import {
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  createHttpLink,
} from "@apollo/client/core"

const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql",
})

export const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  defaultOptions: {
    watchQuery: {
      fetchPolicy: "cache-and-network",
    },
  },
})

// main.ts
import {createApp, provide, h} from "vue"
import {DefaultApolloClient} from "@vue/apollo-composable"
import App from "./App.vue"
import {apolloClient} from "./apollo"

const app = createApp({
  setup() {
    provide(DefaultApolloClient, apolloClient)
  },
  render: () => h(App),
})

app.mount("#app")
```

This configuration creates an Apollo Client instance with a default in-memory cache and provides it to the entire Vue application.

### 2. Executing Queries with Apollo Client

Apollo Client provides the `useQuery` composable for executing GraphQL queries. Here's an example of fetching a list of posts:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import {useQuery} from "@vue/apollo-composable"
  import gql from "graphql-tag"
  import {computed} from "vue"

  interface Post {
    id: number
    title: string
    body: string
    user: {
      name: string
    }
  }

  const GET_POSTS = gql`
    query GetPosts($limit: Int!) {
      posts(limit: $limit) {
        id
        title
        body
        user {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  `

  const {result, loading, error, refetch} = useQuery<{
    posts: Post[]
  }>(GET_POSTS, {
    limit: 10,
  })

  const posts = computed(() => result.value?.posts || [])

  const fetchPosts = () => {
    refetch()
  }
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="fetchPosts" :disabled="loading">
      Fetch Posts
    </button>
    <div v-if="loading">Loading...</div>
    <ul v-else-if="posts.length">
      <li v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">
        {{ post.title }} by {{ post.user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div v-else-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

This example demonstrates:

1. Defining a GraphQL query using `gql` tag
2. Using the `useQuery` composable to manage the query execution
3. Handling loading, error, and success states
4. Implementing a refetch mechanism for manual query execution

### 3. Mutations and Optimistic Updates

Apollo Client supports GraphQL mutations with optimistic updates for responsive UIs:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import {useMutation} from "@vue/apollo-composable"
  import gql from "graphql-tag"
  import {ref} from "vue"

  const CREATE_POST = gql`
    mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $body: String!) {
      createPost(input: {title: $title, body: $body}) {
        id
        title
        body
      }
    }
  `

  const {
    mutate: createPost,
    loading,
    error,
  } = useMutation(CREATE_POST)

  const title = ref("")
  const body = ref("")

  const submitPost = async () => {
    try {
      const {data} = await createPost(
        {
          title: title.value,
          body: body.value,
        },
        {
          optimisticResponse: {
            createPost: {
              __typename: "Post",
              id: "temp-id",
              title: title.value,
              body: body.value,
            },
          },
          update: (cache, {data}) => {
            // Update cache logic here
          },
        },
      )
      console.log("Post created:", data.createPost)
      // Reset form
      title.value = ""
      body.value = ""
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error creating post:", e)
    }
  }
</script>

<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="submitPost">
    <input v-model="title" placeholder="Title" required />
    <textarea
      v-model="body"
      placeholder="Body"
      required
    ></textarea>
    <button type="submit" :disabled="loading">
      Create Post
    </button>
    <div v-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>
  </form>
</template>
```

This example showcases:

1. Defining a GraphQL mutation
2. Using the `useMutation` composable
3. Implementing optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
4. Handling form submission and mutation execution

### 4. Advanced Apollo Client Features

### Caching and Normalization

Apollo Client's normalized cache is a powerful feature for efficient data management:

```typescript
import {InMemoryCache, makeVar} from "@apollo/client/core"

export const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Query: {
      fields: {
        posts: {
          merge(existing, incoming) {
            return incoming
          },
        },
      },
    },
    Post: {
      fields: {
        isLiked: {
          read() {
            return likedPostsVar().includes(this.id)
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

export const likedPostsVar = makeVar<number[]>([])
```

This setup demonstrates:

1. Custom merge functions for query results
2. Computed fields based on reactive variables
3. Using reactive variables for local state management

#### Error Handling and Retry Logic

Implement robust error handling and retry logic:

```typescript
import {ApolloLink} from "@apollo/client/core"
import {onError} from "@apollo/client/link/error"
import {RetryLink} from "@apollo/client/link/retry"

const errorLink = onError(
  ({graphQLErrors, networkError}) => {
    if (graphQLErrors)
      graphQLErrors.forEach(({message, locations, path}) =>
        console.log(
          `[GraphQL error]: Message: ${message}, Location: ${locations}, Path: ${path}`,
        ),
      )
    if (networkError)
      console.log(`[Network error]: ${networkError}`)
  },
)

const retryLink = new RetryLink({
  delay: {
    initial: 300,
    max: Infinity,
    jitter: true,
  },
  attempts: {
    max: 5,
    retryIf: (error, _operation) => !!error,
  },
})

const link = ApolloLink.from([
  errorLink,
  retryLink,
  httpLink,
])
```

This configuration adds comprehensive error logging and automatic retry for failed requests.

### 5. Performance Optimization

To optimize performance when using Apollo Client with Vue:

1. **Implement pagination** for large datasets:

   ```html
   <script setup lang="ts">
     import {useQuery} from "@vue/apollo-composable"
     import gql from "graphql-tag"
     import {ref, computed} from "vue"

     const GET_POSTS = gql`
       query GetPosts($offset: Int!, $limit: Int!) {
         posts(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
           id
           title
         }
       }
     `

     const limit = ref(10)
     const offset = ref(0)

     const {result, loading, fetchMore} = useQuery(
       GET_POSTS,
       () => ({
         offset: offset.value,
         limit: limit.value,
       }),
     )

     const posts = computed(() => result.value?.posts || [])

     const loadMore = () => {
       offset.value += limit.value
       fetchMore({
         variables: {
           offset: offset.value,
           limit: limit.value,
         },
       })
     }
   </script>
   ```

2. **Use fragments** for reusable query parts:

   ```typescript
   import gql from "graphql-tag"

   export const POST_FRAGMENT = gql`
     fragment PostDetails on Post {
       id
       title
       body
       createdAt
     }
   `

   export const GET_POSTS = gql`
     ${POST_FRAGMENT}
     query GetPosts {
       posts {
         ...PostDetails
       }
     }
   `
   ```

3. **Leverage Apollo Client DevTools** for performance monitoring and cache inspection.

### 3. Executing Queries with URQL

URQL provides a `useQuery` composable for executing GraphQL queries. Here's an example of fetching a list of posts:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import {useQuery} from "@urql/vue"
  import {ref, watch} from "vue"

  const postsQuery = `
  query GetPosts {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      user {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`

  const {executeQuery, fetching, error, data} = useQuery({
    query: postsQuery,
    pause: true, // Start paused to allow manual execution
  })

  const posts = ref([])
  const fetchPosts = () => {
    executeQuery()
  }

  watch(data, (newData) => {
    if (newData) {
      posts.value = newData.posts
    }
  })
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="fetchPosts" :disabled="fetching">
      Fetch Posts
    </button>
    <div v-if="fetching">Loading...</div>
    <ul v-else-if="posts.length">
      <li v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">
        {{ post.title }} by {{ post.user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div v-else-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Define a GraphQL query
2. Use the `useQuery` composable to manage the query execution
3. Handle loading, error, and success states
4. Manually trigger the query execution

### 4. Mutations and State Updates

URQL also supports GraphQL mutations for modifying data. Here's an example of creating a new post:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import {useMutation} from "@urql/vue"
  import {ref} from "vue"

  const createPostMutation = `
  mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $body: String!) {
    createPost(input: { title: $title, body: $body }) {
      id
      title
      body
    }
  }
`

  const {executeMutation, fetching, error} = useMutation(
    createPostMutation,
  )

  const title = ref("")
  const body = ref("")

  const createPost = async () => {
    const result = await executeMutation({
      title: title.value,
      body: body.value,
    })
    if (result.data) {
      console.log("Post created:", result.data.createPost)
      // Reset form or update local state
      title.value = ""
      body.value = ""
    }
  }
</script>

<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="createPost">
    <input v-model="title" placeholder="Title" required />
    <textarea
      v-model="body"
      placeholder="Body"
      required
    ></textarea>
    <button type="submit" :disabled="fetching">
      Create Post
    </button>
    <div v-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>
  </form>
</template>
```

This example showcases:

1. Defining a GraphQL mutation
2. Using the `useMutation` composable
3. Handling form submission and mutation execution
4. Managing loading and error states for the mutation

### 5. Advanced URQL Features and Best Practices

#### Caching and Normalization

URQL provides a document cache by default, but for more complex applications, you might want to use the normalized cache:

```typescript
import {
  createClient,
  dedupExchange,
  cacheExchange,
  fetchExchange,
} from "@urql/vue"
import {normalizedCache} from "@urql/exchange-graphcache"

const client = createClient({
  url: "https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql",
  exchanges: [
    dedupExchange,
    normalizedCache({
      keys: {
        Post: (data) => data.id,
      },
      resolvers: {
        Query: {
          post: (_, args) => ({
            __typename: "Post",
            id: args.id,
          }),
        },
      },
    }),
    fetchExchange,
  ],
})
```

This setup enables more efficient caching and automatic updates for related queries when mutations occur.

#### Error Handling and Retry Logic

Implement robust error handling and retry logic:

```typescript
import {retry} from "@urql/exchange-retry"

const client = createClient({
  // ... other configuration
  exchanges: [
    dedupExchange,
    cacheExchange,
    retry({
      retryIf: (error) =>
        !!(error.networkError || error.graphQLErrors),
      maxNumberAttempts: 3,
    }),
    fetchExchange,
  ],
})
```

This configuration adds automatic retry for network errors or GraphQL errors, improving the resilience of your application.

### 6. Performance Optimization

To optimize performance when using URQL with Vue:

1. **Leverage server-side rendering (SSR)** for initial data loading:

   ```typescript
   import {createClient, ssrExchange} from "@urql/vue"

   const ssr = ssrExchange({
     isClient: typeof window !== "undefined",
   })

   const client = createClient({
     url: "https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql",
     exchanges: [
       dedupExchange,
       cacheExchange,
       ssr,
       fetchExchange,
     ],
   })
   ```

2. **Implement pagination** for large datasets:

   ```html
   <script setup lang="ts">
     import {useQuery} from "@urql/vue"
     import {ref, computed} from "vue"

     const postsQuery = `
     query GetPosts($limit: Int!, $offset: Int!) {
       posts(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
         id
         title
       }
     }
   `

     const limit = ref(10)
     const offset = ref(0)

     const {data, fetching, error} = useQuery({
       query: postsQuery,
       variables: computed(() => ({
         limit: limit.value,
         offset: offset.value,
       })),
     })

     const loadMore = () => {
       offset.value += limit.value
     }
   </script>
   ```

3. **Use fragments** for reusable query parts:

   ```typescript
   const PostFragment = `
     fragment PostDetails on Post {
       id
       title
       body
       createdAt
     }
   `

   const postsQuery = `
     ${PostFragment}
     query GetPosts {
       posts {
         ...PostDetails
       }
     }
   `
   ```

## Fetch API - The DIY Dynamo

In modern web development, effective data fetching is a cornerstone for building dynamic and responsive applications. While powerful libraries like Apollo and URQL offer extensive features for GraphQL integration, there are situations where a more hands-on approach is desirable. Enter the Fetch API: a versatile, built-in tool for making network requests, allowing developers to craft their GraphQL interactions from the ground up. This tutorial will guide you through using the Fetch API for GraphQL data fetching in Vue.js, providing a deep understanding of the process and its practical applications.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Installation and Integration Steps

One of the key advantages of the Fetch API is its built-in availability in modern browsers. This means no additional package installations are required, simplifying the setup process.

#### Code Snippets

Let's start by setting up a basic Vue component that uses the Fetch API to query a GraphQL endpoint.

```html
<template>
  <div class="fetch-example">
    <h2>Fetch API Example</h2>
    <button @click="fetchPosts" :disabled="loading">
      Fetch Posts
    </button>
    <div v-if="networkError" class="error">
      Network Error: {{ networkError }}
    </div>
    <div v-if="graphqlError" class="error">
      GraphQL Error: {{ graphqlError }}
    </div>
    <div v-if="unexpectedError" class="error">
      Unexpected Error: {{ unexpectedError }}
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">
        {{ post.title }} by {{ post.user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
  import {ref} from "vue"

  interface Post {
    id: number
    title: string
    body: string
    user: {
      name: string
    }
  }

  const posts = ref<Post[]>([])
  const loading = ref(false)
  const networkError = ref<string | null>(null)
  const graphqlError = ref<string | null>(null)
  const unexpectedError = ref<string | null>(null)

  const fetchPosts = async () => {
    loading.value = true
    networkError.value = null
    graphqlError.value = null
    unexpectedError.value = null

    try {
      const response = await fetch("/graphql", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
