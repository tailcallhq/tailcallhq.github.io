If GraphQL clients were cars, Apollo would be the Tesla of the bunch - sleek, powerful, and packed with features you didn't even know you needed. Let's pop the hood and see what makes this beauty purr!  Installation and Integration Steps​  Before we can take Apollo for a spin, we need to get it set up in our garage (I mean, project). Here's how:  Install the necessary packages:: npm install apollo-angular @apollo/client graphql Configure Apollo in your app.config.ts: import { APOLLO_OPTIONS, ApolloModule } from 'apollo-angular'; import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-angular/http'; import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client/core'; // In your ApplicationConfig { providers: [ importProvidersFrom(ApolloModule), { provide: APOLLO_OPTIONS, useFactory: (httpLink: HttpLink) =&gt; ({ cache: new InMemoryCache(), link: httpLink.create({ uri: '/graphql', }), }), deps: [HttpLink], }, ], } Code SnippetsNow that we've got our Apollo rocket fueled up, let's see it in action! Here's a component that fetches a list of posts using Apollo in src/app/apollo-angular/post-list.component.ts:  import {Component, OnDestroy} from &quot;@angular/core&quot; import {CommonModule} from &quot;@angular/common&quot; import {Apollo, gql} from &quot;apollo-angular&quot; import {ChangeDetectorRef} from &quot;@angular/core&quot; import { catchError, takeUntil, mergeMap, } from &quot;rxjs/operators&quot; import {Subject, of, throwError} from &quot;rxjs&quot; @Component({ selector: &quot;app-apollo-post-list&quot;, standalone: true, imports: [CommonModule], template: ` &lt;h2&gt;Posts (Apollo Angular)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;fetchPosts()&quot; [disabled]=&quot;loading&quot;&gt; {{ loading ? &quot;Loading...&quot; : &quot;Load Posts&quot; }} &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;triggerNetworkError()&quot;&gt; Trigger Network Error &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;triggerGraphQLError()&quot;&gt; Trigger GraphQL Error &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;triggerUnexpectedError()&quot;&gt; Trigger Unexpected Error &lt;/button&gt; &lt;ul *ngIf=&quot;!error&quot;&gt; &lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let post of posts&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;error&quot; class=&quot;error-message&quot;&gt; {{ error }} &lt;/div&gt; `, styles: [ ` .error-message { color: red; margin-top: 10px; } `, ], }) export class ApolloPostListComponent implements OnDestroy { // ...

(error handling and simulation methods) }   Wow, would you look at that beauty? 😍 This component is like a finely tuned engine, ready to fetch your posts with the precision of a Swiss watch. Let's break down what's happening here:  We're using Apollo's watchQuery method to fetch our posts. It's like having a personal assistant who's always on the lookout for the latest data.We've got some nifty error simulation methods. It's like having a crash test dummy for your data fetching - you can deliberately cause errors to see how your app handles them. Safety first, right?The mergeMap operator is our traffic controller, deciding whether to let the data through or throw an error based on our simulation flags.We're using takeUntil with a Subject to ensure we clean up our subscriptions when the component is destroyed. It's like having an eco-friendly car that doesn't leave any pollution (memory leaks) behind!The template gives us a simple UI to fetch posts and trigger various error scenarios. It's like having a dashboard with different buttons to test your car's performance.  Error Handling​  Speaking of errors, Apollo doesn't just fetch data - it's got your back when things go wrong. Check out this error handling logic:   private handleError(error: any) { this.loading = false; if (error.networkError) { this.error = 'Network error. Please check your internet connection.'; } else if (error.graphQLErrors) { this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.graphQLErrors .map((e: { message: any }) =&gt; e.message) .join(', ')}`; } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } console.error('Error fetching posts', error); this.cdr.detectChanges(); }   This error handler is like having a built-in mechanic. Whether it's a network issue (like running out of gas) or a GraphQL error (engine trouble), it's got you covered with user-friendly messages.  Wrapping Up Apollo Angular​  And there you have it, folks! Apollo Angular - the smooth-riding, feature-packed, error-handling marvel of the GraphQL world. It's like driving a luxury car with a supercomputer onboard.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"2. Axios - The Versatile Muscle Car of HTTP Clients​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Apollo vs Urql vs Fetch: The Ultimate Showdown","url":"/blog/graphql-angular-client/#2-axios---the-versatile-muscle-car-of-http-clients","content":" If Apollo Angular is the luxury sports car of GraphQL clients, then Axios is like a classic muscle car - powerful, versatile, and ready to handle anything you throw at it. It might not have all the GraphQL-specific bells and whistles, but boy, can it perform!  1. Installation and Integration Steps​  Before we hit the gas, let's get our Axios engine installed and tuned up:  Installations.  First, rev up your terminal and run:  npm install axios   Unlike Apollo, Axios doesn't need any special configuration in your app.config.ts. It's more of a plug-and-play solution. Just import it where you need it, and you're good to go!  Code Snippets  Now, below we implement data fetching using axios in src/app/axios-angular/post-list.component.ts:  import { Component, OnInit, ChangeDetectorRef, } from &quot;@angular/core&quot; import {CommonModule} from &quot;@angular/common&quot; import axios, {AxiosInstance, AxiosError} from &quot;axios&quot; @Component({ selector: &quot;app-axios-post-list&quot;, standalone: true, imports: [CommonModule], template: ` &lt;h2&gt;Posts (Axios Angular)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;fetchPosts()&quot; [disabled]=&quot;loading&quot;&gt; {{ loading ? &quot;Loading...&quot; : &quot;Load Posts&quot; }} &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;triggerNetworkError()&quot;&gt; Trigger Network Error &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;triggerGraphQLError()&quot;&gt; Trigger GraphQL Error &lt;/button&gt; &lt;button (click)=&quot;triggerUnexpectedError()&quot;&gt; Trigger Unexpected Error &lt;/button&gt; &lt;ul *ngIf=&quot;!error&quot;&gt; &lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let post of posts&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;error&quot; class=&quot;error-message&quot;&gt; {{ error }} &lt;/div&gt; `, // ... (styles omitted for brevity) }) export class AxiosPostsListsComponent implements OnInit { private client: AxiosInstance posts: any[] = [] loading = false error: string | null = null // Error simulation flags private simulateNetworkError = false private simulateGraphQLError = false private simulateUnexpectedError = false constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) { this.client = axios.create({ baseURL: &quot;/graphql&quot;, headers: { &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, }, }) } ngOnInit() { // Add a request interceptor this.client.interceptors.request.use( (config) =&gt; { if (this.simulateNetworkError) { return Promise.reject( new Error(&quot;Simulated network error&quot;), ) } return config }, (error) =&gt; Promise.reject(error), ) } private GET_DATA = ` query GetPosts($limit: Int) { posts(limit: $limit) { id title ${this.simulateGraphQLError ? &quot;nonExistentField&quot; : &quot;&quot;} } } ` async query(queryString: string, variables: any = {}) { try { if (this.simulateUnexpectedError) { throw new Error(&quot;Simulated unexpected error&quot;) } const response = await this.client.post(&quot;&quot;, { query: queryString, variables, }) return response.data } catch (error) { this.handleError(error) throw error } } async fetchPosts() { this.loading = true this.error = null this.posts = [] this.cdr.detectChanges() try { const result = await this.query(this.GET_DATA, { limit: 10, }) this.posts = result.data.posts this.loading = false this.cdr.detectChanges() } catch (error) { // Error is already handled in query method this.loading = false this.cdr.detectChanges() } } // ... (error handling and simulation methods omitted for brevity) }   This Axios-powered component is revving up to fetch those posts faster than you can say &quot;GraphQL&quot;! Let's break down what's happening in this high-octane code:  We're creating an Axios instance in the constructor. It's like customizing your car with a specific paint job (baseURL) and some cool decals (headers).The ngOnInit method adds a request interceptor. Think of it as a nitrous oxide system - it can give your requests an extra boost or, in this case, simulate a network error if you want to test your error handling.Our query method is like the engine of this muscle car. It takes a GraphQL query string and variables, then fires off the request. If something goes wrong, it calls our trusty mechanic (the handleError method).The fetchPosts method is where the rubber meets the road. It calls our query method with the posts query, then updates our component state with the results.We've got our error simulation methods, just like in the Apollo example. It's like having different test tracks for your muscle car - you can simulate various error conditions to make sure your code can handle any bumps in the road.  2. Error Handling​  Now, let's talk about handling of errors:   private handleError(error: any) { if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) { const axiosError = error as AxiosError; if (axiosError.response) { // The request was made and the server responded with a status code // that falls out of the range of 2xx this.error = `Server error: ${axiosError.response.status} ${axiosError.response.statusText}`; } else if (axiosError.request) { // The request was made but no response was received this.error = 'Network error. Please check your internet connection.'; } else { // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } } else if (error.graphQLErrors) { this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.graphQLErrors .map((e: any) =&gt; e.message) .join(', ')}`; } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } console.error('Error fetching posts:', error); }   This error handler is like the world's best shock absorber system. Whether you hit a pothole (network error), take a wrong turn (server error), or your engine misfires (unexpected error), it's got you covered with user-friendly messages. It even handles those tricky GraphQL-specific errors!  Wrapping Up Axios​  And there you have it, Axios - the muscle car of HTTP clients, now tuned up to handle GraphQL queries with style. It might not have all the GraphQL-specific features of Apollo, but it's a powerhouse that can handle just about anything you throw at it. Axios shines when you need a lightweight, versatile solution that can handle both REST and GraphQL APIs. It's like having a car that's equally at home on the racetrack and the city streets. Plus, if you're already familiar with Axios from REST API work, the learning curve here is as smooth as a freshly paved highway.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"3.

Let's break down what's happening in this high-speed code:  No imports needed for Fetch - it's built right into the browser. It's like having a motorcycle that doesn't need gas!Our query method is the engine of this speed machine. It takes a GraphQL query string and variables, then zooms off to fetch the data.We're using async/await syntax, which makes our asynchronous code read like a smooth ride down the highway.The fetchPosts method is where we kick into high gear. It calls our query method with the posts query, then updates our component state with the results.We've still got our error simulation methods. It's like having different obstacle courses for our motorcycle - we can test how it handles in various tricky situations.  Error Handling​  Now, let's talk about the suspension system of our Fetch motorcycle - the error handling:   private handleError(error: any) { if (error instanceof TypeError &amp;&amp; error.message === 'Failed to fetch') { this.error = 'Network error. Please check your internet connection.'; } else if (error instanceof Error) { if (error.message.includes('GraphQL error')) { this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.message}`; } else if (error.message.startsWith('HTTP error!')) { this.error = `Server error: ${error.message}`; } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } console.error('Error fetching posts:', error); }   This error handler efficiently manages various error types. It provides user-friendly messages for network issues, server errors, unexpected problems, and GraphQL-specific errors, ensuring a smooth user experience even when things go wrong.  Wrapping Up Fetch API​  And there you have it, The Fetch API - the nimble, lightweight motorcycle of HTTP clients, now revved up to handle GraphQL queries with style. It might not have all the bells and whistles of Apollo or the versatility of Axios, but it's fast, it's built-in, and it gets the job done with minimal fuss.  Fetch shines when you need a lightweight, no-dependency solution that can handle both REST and GraphQL APIs. It's like having a motorcycle that's equally at home zipping through city traffic or cruising on the open highway.

Error Handling​  Now, let's talk about the advanced traction control system of our GraphQL Request sports car - the error handling:   private handleError(error: any) { if (error instanceof ClientError) { if (error.response.errors) { // GraphQL errors this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.response.errors .map((e) =&gt; e.message) .join(', ')}`; } else { // Network errors or other HTTP errors this.error = `Network error: ${error.response.status} ${error.response['statusText']}`; } } else if (error instanceof Error) { if (error.message === 'Simulated network error') { this.error = 'Network error. Please check your internet connection.'; } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } console.error('Error fetching posts:', error); }   This error handler is like having the world's best traction control and stability management system. Whether you hit a patch of black ice (network error), take a corner too fast (GraphQL error), or encounter an unexpected obstacle (other errors), it's got you covered with user-friendly messages. It even distinguishes between different types of errors, giving you precise control over how to handle each situation.  Wrapping Up GraphQL Request​  And there you have it, folks! GraphQL Request - the precision-engineered sports car of GraphQL clients. It's streamlined, efficient, and designed specifically for the twists and turns of GraphQL queries. GraphQL Request shines when you need a lightweight, GraphQL-specific solution that offers more than Fetch but doesn't require the full ecosystem of Apollo. It's like having a sports car that's perfect for both daily commutes and weekend track days. Plus, its simplicity makes it a joy to work with, especially for smaller to medium-sized projects.

Urql in Angular​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Apollo vs Urql vs Fetch: The Ultimate Showdown","url":"/blog/graphql-angular-client/#5-urql-in-angular","content":" Installation and Integration Steps​  First things first, let's get our hands dirty with some installation magic. To bring Urql into your Angular project, you'll need to wave your command line wand and chant:  npm install @urql/core graphql   We need to set up our Urql client.  Code Snippets and Explanation​  Let's break down our UrqlPostListComponent which you'll create following the same format above and solder structure:  import { createClient, fetchExchange, cacheExchange, Client, } from &quot;@urql/core&quot; // ... other imports export class UrqlPostListComponent { client: Client constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) { this.client = createClient({ url: &quot;http://localhost:4200/graphql&quot;, exchanges: [cacheExchange, fetchExchange], }) } // ... rest of the component }   Here, we're setting up our Urql client faster than you can say &quot;GraphQL&quot;. We're telling it where to find our GraphQL endpoint and which exchanges to use. Think of exchanges as middleware for your GraphQL requests - they're like bouncers at a club, deciding how to handle incoming and outgoing traffic.  Now, let's look at how we're fetching posts:   getPostsQuery = gql` query GetPosts($limit: Int) { posts(limit: $limit) { id title } } `; fetchPosts() { this.loading = true; this.error = null; this.posts = []; this.cdr.detectChanges(); this.client .query(this.getPostsQuery, { limit: 10 }) .toPromise() .then((result) =&gt; { if (result.error) { this.handleError(result.error); } else { this.posts = result.data?.posts || []; this.loading = false; this.cdr.detectChanges(); } }) .catch((error) =&gt; this.handleError(error)) .finally(() =&gt; { this.loading = false; this.cdr.detectChanges(); }); }   This fetchPosts method is where the magic happens. We're using Urql's query method to fetch our posts, handling the result like a pro juggler. If there's an error, we toss it to our error handler. If it's successful, we update our posts faster than you can say &quot;data fetched&quot;!  Error Handling​  Now, let's talk about error handling. In the world of APIs, errors are like unexpected plot twists in a movie - they keep things interesting, but you need to know how to handle them:   private handleError(error: any) { this.loading = false; if (error instanceof CombinedError) { if (error.networkError) { this.error = 'Network error. Please check your internet connection.'; } else if (error.graphQLErrors.length &gt; 0) { this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.graphQLErrors .map((e) =&gt; e.message) .join(', ')}`; } } else if (error instanceof Error) { this.error = `An unexpected error occurred: ${error.message}`; } else { this.error = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'; } console.error('Error fetching posts:', error); this.cdr.detectChanges(); }   This error handler is like a Swiss Army knife for API errors. Network error? We've got you covered. GraphQL error? No problem. Unexpected error that makes you question the nature of reality? We handle that too! Why Choose Urql? You might be wondering, &quot;Why should I choose Urql over other options?&quot; Well, let me tell you, Urql is like that cool, efficient friend who always knows the best way to get things done:  Lightweight: Urql is as light as a feather, which means your app won't feel like it's carrying extra baggage.Flexible: It's adaptable to various use cases, like a chameleon in the coding world.Great Developer Experience: With Urql, you'll feel like you're coding with a tailwind, not against a headwind.  tip Want to see all this in action?

Let's recap and draw some final insights:  Apollo Angular emerges as the powerhouse solution, offering a comprehensive feature set including robust caching, state management, and optimistic UI updates. It's ideal for large-scale applications with complex data requirements, though it comes with a steeper learning curve and larger bundle size. Urql strikes a balance between functionality and simplicity. Its lightweight nature and extensible architecture make it an excellent choice for projects that need flexibility without the full weight of Apollo. It's particularly suitable for medium-sized applications or teams that prefer a more customizable approach. GraphQL-Request shines in its simplicity. For small projects or microservices where basic GraphQL operations are all that's needed, it provides a no-frills solution with minimal overhead. However, it lacks built-in caching and advanced features, which may become limitations as your project grows. Axios, while not GraphQL-specific, leverages its widespread adoption and familiarity among developers. It's a solid choice for teams already using Axios in their stack or for projects that mix RESTful and GraphQL APIs. However, it requires more manual work for GraphQL-specific features. Fetch API represents the most lightweight approach, with zero additional bundle size. It's ideal for projects prioritizing minimal dependencies and maximum browser compatibility. However, it necessitates more boilerplate code and manual implementation of GraphQL-specific features.  The choice between these approaches ultimately depends on your project's specific needs, your team's expertise, and your application's scalability requirements. Here are some final recommendations:  For large, data-intensive applications with complex requirements, Apollo Angular is likely your best bet.If you're looking for a lightweight yet capable solution, Urql offers an excellent middle ground.For smaller projects or microservices, GraphQL-Request or Fetch API might be sufficient.If your project involves a mix of REST and GraphQL APIs, consider Axios for its versatility.  Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The best approach is the one that aligns with your project's needs and your team's capabilities. As your application evolves, don't hesitate to reassess and switch approaches if necessary.  Whichever path you choose, GraphQL's power in providing flexible, efficient data fetching can significantly enhance your Angular applications. By understanding these different approaches, you're now equipped to make an informed decision and leverage GraphQL to its full potential in your Angular projects.

An attacker who gains access to a GraphQL endpoint can use introspection to explore the schema and identify potential targets for further attacks. This includes discovering sensitive types and fields, as well as understanding the relationships between different parts of the schema. Armed with this knowledge, an attacker can craft more effective queries to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.  For instance, an attacker might discover a 'User' type with fields like 'email', 'password', and 'isAdmin'. They could then craft a query to exploit this:  query { allUsers { email password isAdmin } }   If not properly secured, this query could potentially expose sensitive user data. The attacker might also notice an 'updateUser' mutation, which could be a target for privilege escalation attempts.

Without introspection, they can't easily map out your API's structure or discover hidden fields and types. This forces attackers to rely on guesswork or prior knowledge, making their job much more difficult. However, it's important to note that this is not a silver bullet—determined attackers may still attempt to reverse-engineer your API through trial and error.  In many GraphQL implementations, disabling introspection is straightforward. For example, in Tailcall, you can disable introspection by setting the introspection option to false:  schema @server(introspection: false) { query: Query mutation: Mutation }   This configuration ensures that introspection is disabled.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Implement Authentication and Authorization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Are Hackers Using Your Own GraphQL API Against You?","url":"/blog/graphql-introspection-security/#implement-authentication-and-authorization","content":" Another critical measure is to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. By ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access your GraphQL endpoint, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized introspection queries. Use industry-standard authentication protocols such as OAuth2 or JWT to secure your endpoints.  Imagine a GraphQL API for a banking application. You might implement role-based access control where only users with an 'ADMIN' role can access certain fields or mutations.  In Tailcall, you can achieve this by using the @protected directive.  Tailcall supports a variety of authentication and authorization mechanisms, including JWT, OAuth2, and custom authentication strategies.  This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to a regular user account, they can't use it to access sensitive admin-only data or operations.

","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Query Allow Lists​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Are Hackers Using Your Own GraphQL API Against You?","url":"/blog/graphql-introspection-security/#query-allow-lists","content":" Query allow lists work by pre-registering all valid queries that your application needs. This is typically done during the build process of your frontend application. Each query is hashed, and these hashes are stored on the server. When a query comes in, its hash is checked against the allow list.  For example, you might have a client-side query like this:  query GetUserProfile($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name email } }   This query would be hashed and stored on the server. When executed, the server checks if the incoming query's hash matches any in its allow list. If not, it's rejected.

Check this out:  interface Node { id: ID! } type User implements Node { id: ID! name: String! } type Team implements Node { id: ID! name: String! } type Organization implements Node { id: ID! name: String! employees: [User!]! }   By adding the Organization type, we've expanded what could be returned by queries selecting for Node. This could break clients that aren't prepared to handle new types. Always encourage clients to use proper type checking.  query { node(id: &quot;1&quot;) { ... on User { name } ... on Team { name } ... on Organization { name employees { name } } } }   Without proper type checking, clients might encounter these issues:  Runtime Errors: If a client assumes all Node types have only a name field, they might try to access employees on a User or Team, causing errors.Missing Data: Clients might not display Organization-specific data if they're not prepared to handle it.Incorrect Data Processing: Business logic that assumes only User and Team types exist might produce incorrect results.  To mitigate these issues:  Use TypeScript or Flow on the client-side to catch type errors at compile-time.Implement exhaustive type checking in your client code:  function handleNode(node: Node) { switch (node.__typename) { case &quot;User&quot;: return handleUser(node) case &quot;Team&quot;: return handleTeam(node) case &quot;Organization&quot;: return handleOrganization(node) default: const _exhaustiveCheck: never = node throw new Error(`Unhandled node type: ${(_exhaustiveCheck as any).__typename}`) } }   This approach ensures that if a new type is added in the future, TypeScript will raise a compile-time error, prompting developers to update their code.

Let's delve into why union expansions can be tricky and how to handle them gracefully:  When you add Comment to the SearchResult union, existing clients might break in subtle ways:  Incomplete UI: If the client only has UI components for User and Post, Comment results won't be displayed.Runtime Errors: Code that assumes only User and Post types exist might throw errors when encountering a Comment.  To handle this gracefully:  Implement a fallback UI component for unknown types: function SearchResultItem({result}) { switch (result.__typename) { case &quot;User&quot;: return &lt;UserResult user={result} /&gt; case &quot;Post&quot;: return &lt;PostResult post={result} /&gt; case &quot;Comment&quot;: return &lt;CommentResult comment={result} /&gt; default: return &lt;UnknownResultType type={result.__typename} /&gt; } } Encourage clients to use introspection queries to stay updated on schema changes: query { __type(name: &quot;SearchResult&quot;) { kinds possibleTypes { name } } }   By implementing these strategies, clients can gracefully handle new union members without breaking existing functionality.

Approach to Data Retrieval​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GraphQL vs OpenAPI: Part 1 of the API Comparison Series","url":"/blog/graphql-vs-openapi-part-1/#a-approach-to-data-retrieval","content":" GraphQL Query Language vs OpenAPI REST Endpoints​  GraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the response, making it highly flexible. OpenAPI, on the other hand, relies on predefined endpoints for data retrieval.  GraphQL: Query Flexibility​  GraphQL's query flexibility is a game-changer for frontend developers. Imagine you're building a user profile page that needs to display a user's name, email, recent posts, and follower count. With a REST API, you might need to make multiple requests to different endpoints (/user, /posts, /followers) to gather all this data. But with GraphQL, you can request all this information in a single query:  query { user(id: &quot;123&quot;) { name email recentPosts(limit: 5) { title date } followerCount } }   This not only reduces the number of network requests but also eliminates over-fetching of data. If you only need the user's name and email, you simply omit the other fields from your query. This flexibility allows frontend developers to iterate quickly without waiting for backend changes, significantly speeding up development cycles.  OpenAPI: Defined Endpoints​  OpenAPI follows the REST architecture, where each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or action, providing a clear structure but less flexibility.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"B. Type System and Validation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GraphQL vs OpenAPI: Part 1 of the API Comparison Series","url":"/blog/graphql-vs-openapi-part-1/#b-type-system-and-validation","content":" GraphQL: Strong Typing at Runtime​  GraphQL uses a robust type system to validate queries at runtime, ensuring clients only request valid data and fields. This strong typing mechanism helps prevent errors before they occur by enforcing a strict schema that defines the types of data that can be queried and the relationships between different data entities. By validating queries against this schema, GraphQL ensures that clients can only access the data they are permitted to and that they do so in a predictable manner. This type safety not only improves the reliability of the API but also enhances developer productivity by providing clear, self-documenting APIs.  Example GraphQL Schema:  type User { id: ID! name: String! email: String! posts: [Post] } type Post { id: ID! title: String! content: String! author: User } type Query { user(id: ID!): User allUsers: [User] post(id: ID!): Post allPosts: [Post] } type Mutation { createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User createPost( title: String! content: String! authorId: ID! ): Post }   Example GraphQL Query:  query { user(id: &quot;123&quot;) { id name email posts { id title content } } allPosts { id title content author { id name } } }   In this example, the schema defines User and Post types, their fields, and the relationships between them. The Query type includes operations for fetching users and posts, and the Mutation type includes operations for creating users and posts. The query fetches a specific user and their posts, as well as all posts and their authors.  For a deeper dive into GraphQL schemas and types, you can explore this resource.  OpenAPI: Schema Validation​  OpenAPI's use of JSON/YAML Schema for validation is more powerful than it might initially appear. Let's break this down with an example. Suppose you're building an e-commerce API. You could define a product schema like this:  components: schemas: Product: type: object required: - id - name - price properties: id: type: integer name: type: string minLength: 1 maxLength: 100 price: type: number minimum: 0 description: type: string categories: type: array items: type: string   This schema does more than just define the structure. It enforces business rules:  Products must have an id, name, and price (required fields) Product names must be between 1 and 100 characters Prices can't be negative  By defining these constraints in the OpenAPI spec, you're not just documenting your API - you're creating a contract that can be enforced by API gateways, automatically validated in tests, and used to generate accurate client SDKs. This level of detail at the design stage catches errors early, improves API consistency, and significantly reduces the likelihood of bugs in production.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"C. Schema Definition​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GraphQL vs OpenAPI: Part 1 of the API Comparison Series","url":"/blog/graphql-vs-openapi-part-1/#c-schema-definition","content":" GraphQL SDL vs OpenAPI Swagger​  GraphQL and OpenAPI use different approaches to define and document their APIs.  GraphQL: Schema Definition Language (SDL)  GraphQL uses the Schema Definition Language (SDL) to define the types and relationships within an API. SDL is a human-readable language that allows developers to describe the data structures and operations available on the GraphQL server. This schema acts as a contract between the client and server, ensuring that all queries and mutations adhere to the defined types and structures.  Example of GraphQL SDL:  type User { id: ID! name: String! email: String! posts: [Post] } type Post { id: ID! title: String! content: String! author: User } type Query { user(id: ID!): User allUsers: [User] post(id: ID!): Post allPosts: [Post] } type Mutation { createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User createPost( title: String! content: String! authorId: ID! ): Post }   In this example, the schema defines User and Post types, their fields, and the relationships between them. It also defines queries to fetch users and posts, and mutations to create new users and posts.  OpenAPI: Swagger  OpenAPI uses JSON or YAML to describe endpoints, parameters, and responses. This specification format allows for detailed documentation of RESTful APIs, including request and response formats, authentication methods, and error handling. OpenAPI specifications can be used to generate API documentation, client SDKs, and server stubs, making it a comprehensive tool for API development.  Example of OpenAPI Swagger (YAML format):  openapi: 3.0.0 info: title: Example API version: 1.0.0 paths: /users: get: summary: Get a list of users responses: &quot;200&quot;: description: A list of users content: application/json: schema: type: array items: $ref: &quot;#/components/schemas/User&quot; /users/{id}: get: summary: Get a user by ID parameters: - name: id in: path required: true schema: type: string responses: &quot;200&quot;: description: A user object content: application/json: schema: $ref: &quot;#/components/schemas/User&quot; /posts: post: summary: Create a new post requestBody: required: true content: application/json: schema: $ref: &quot;#/components/schemas/Post&quot; responses: &quot;201&quot;: description: The created post content: application/json: schema: $ref: &quot;#/components/schemas/Post&quot; components: schemas: User: type: object properties: id: type: string name: type: string email: type: string Post: type: object properties: id: type: string title: type: string content: type: string authorId: type: string   In this OpenAPI example, the specification defines paths for fetching users and creating posts, along with the necessary parameters and responses. It also defines the User and Post schemas used in the API.  By using these tools, both GraphQL and OpenAPI provide clear, structured ways to define and document APIs, each with their own strengths and use cases.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"D. API Documentation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GraphQL vs OpenAPI: Part 1 of the API Comparison Series","url":"/blog/graphql-vs-openapi-part-1/#d-api-documentation","content":" GraphQL: Self-Documenting​  GraphQL schemas are inherently self-documenting, allowing clients to introspect the schema and understand available operations. Tools like GraphiQL provide an interactive environment where developers can explore the schema, view available types and fields, and see the relationships between different data entities. This self-documenting feature of GraphQL significantly enhances the developer experience by providing built-in API documentation.  Example: GraphiQL Interface  To demonstrate, let's use the Star Wars API (SWAPI) GraphiQL endpoint here. By navigating to the SWAPI GraphQL interface, you can interact with the API and see how the schema is documented.  Example Query:  { allFilms { films { title director releaseDate } } allPeople { people { name birthYear homeworld { name } } } }   This query fetches details about films and characters from the Star Wars universe. The GraphiQL interface allows you to see the available types, queries, and fields in the documentation tab.  GraphiQL Documentation Snapshot:  In this snapshot of the GraphiQL interface, you can see the documentation tab open, displaying the schema with types and fields such as Film and Person, with fields like title, director, releaseDate, name, birthYear, and homeworld. This clean and professional interface reflects the self-documenting nature of GraphQL schemas, making it easy for developers to understand and use the API effectively.  By using the introspection capabilities of GraphQL and tools like GraphiQL, developers can quickly get up to speed with the API and explore its capabilities interactively.    OpenAPI: Manual and Auto-Generated Options​  OpenAPI supports both manual and auto-generated documentation, which enhances the ease of sharing API details. Tools like Swagger UI allow developers to create interactive API documentation that can be explored and tested directly from the browser. This makes it easier for both developers and non-developers to understand and interact with the API.  Example: Spotify API Documentation  Spotify uses OpenAPI to provide comprehensive and interactive API documentation. Their public-facing documentation, which can be accessed here, showcases the power of auto-generated documentation. With detailed descriptions of endpoints, parameters, and response formats, along with interactive features to test the API, Spotify's documentation serves as an excellent example of how OpenAPI can streamline the process of API development and consumption.  Swagger UI Example:  openapi: 3.0.0 info: title: Spotify API version: 1.0.0 paths: /tracks/{id}: get: summary: Get a track parameters: - name: id in: path required: true schema: type: string responses: &quot;200&quot;: description: A track object content: application/json: schema: $ref: &quot;#/components/schemas/Track&quot; components: schemas: Track: type: object properties: id: type: string name: type: string artist: type: string album: type: string   With Swagger UI, this specification can be rendered into a fully interactive API documentation interface, where users can explore different endpoints, see example requests and responses, and even try out API calls directly from the documentation page. This approach not only improves the developer experience but also helps in maintaining up-to-date and accessible API documentation.  Below, we have a snapshot of the Spotify OpenAPI documentation:    OpenAPI: Manual and Auto-Generated Options​  OpenAPI supports both manual and auto-generated documentation through tools like Swagger UI, making it easier to share API details.

The internet is replete with articles debating the merits and demerits of each, with some even questioning the viability of GraphQL. However, this discourse misses a crucial point: the unique strengths of GraphQL. This article aims to illuminate the distinct advantages GraphQL offers, particularly in addressing a common but complex challenge known as impedance mismatch. Impedance mismatch refers to the discordance between the capabilities of an existing API and the ideal features required for a specific use case. From the perspective of a platform engineer, the goal is to develop APIs that cater to a broad range of needs. Yet, crafting a unique API for every conceivable requirement is neither practical nor efficient. Consequently, engineers often end up creating generalized APIs. However, as a consumer, you might find these APIs lacking in some respects while being superfluous in others. Furthermore, as your needs evolve, so does your notion of the ideal API, exacerbating this mismatch. Herein lies the brilliance of GraphQL: it offers a framework for structuring data exposure and queries that significantly mitigates this issue. The GraphQL specification introduces the concept of viewing data as a graph composed of nodes, which represent domain entities for a business, interconnected by relationships that define their interactions. For instance, in the development of a social network, a user entity might have the ability to create a post, which in turn could receive comments, illustrating the interconnected nature of data entities. With the data conceptualized as a graph, GraphQL advocates for a method of querying that allows for precise data retrieval. This selective querying capability enables developers to request exactly the data they need, distinguishing GraphQL from REST and gRPC which aren't truly a &quot;queryable&quot;. The precision of GraphQL extends to the granularity of specifying individual fields within entities, facilitating extremely efficient and targeted queries. Notably, the GraphQL specification does not prescribe any specific data storage methodologies but focuses on the manner in which data is queried, hence the designation &quot;Graph Query Language.&quot; This approach allows for queries tailored to specific requirements, such as obtaining posts by the current user along with comments on those posts. By enabling precise data queries, GraphQL helps in avoiding the inefficiencies associated with over-fetching or under-fetching data, thereby enhancing overall system performance. The impedance mismatch is not solely a technical issue pertaining to the differences in API schemas. It extends into the realm of development processes as well. GraphQL significantly ameliorates this aspect by allowing the consumers of an API to begin their work even before the actual API is fully implemented. This is made possible through the agreement on a schema upfront. By decoupling the dependency between the consumer and the provider of the API, GraphQL facilitates a more efficient and flexible development process. Comparing GraphQL with REST or gRPC on this front might not do justice to their distinct objectives. REST and gRPC are primarily designed as lightweight RPC protocols, not specifically to address impedance mismatch for which a full fledged query language is more suitable. A more apt comparison would be with OpenAPI, which also allows for API composition. However, OpenAPI's capabilities in fine-tuning what an API delivers are somewhat constrained compared to GraphQL's flexible querying capabilities. Beyond the technical resolution of impedance mismatch, GraphQL addresses a critical business problem: the inefficiency in software development that arises from this gap between actual and ideal APIs. This inefficiency leads to developers spending excessive time on API orchestration—time that could be better spent on core application development. They find themselves constantly writing, revising, and optimizing APIs and their orchestration, as well as managing the fallout from breaking changes. By leveraging GraphQL, developers can significantly reduce these frictions, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity. In essence, GraphQL not only solves a technical problem but also delivers substantial business value by enabling more efficient and flexible software development practices. GraphQL offers an excellent developer experience for API consumption with its intuitive query language that allows for retrieving deeply nested data independently of the upstream source. However, it does have some limitations. At Tailcall, we are dedicated to making GraphQL more accessible and easier to work with.

Use clear, consistent naming: Adopt a naming convention (e.g., PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields) and stick to it. Leverage GraphQL features: Make use of enums, interfaces, and unions to create a rich, expressive schema. Plan for change: Use input types for mutations and consider versioning strategies for evolving your schema over time. Optimize for performance: Be mindful of N+1 query problems and consider implementing DataLoader or similar batching mechanisms. Secure your schema: Implement proper authentication and authorization. Consider using directives for field-level permissions. Validate input: Use non-nullable fields and custom scalars to enforce data integrity at the schema level. Provide meaningful errors: Return detailed error information in your mutation payloads to help clients handle failures gracefully. Monitor and analyze: Implement logging and monitoring to understand how your schema is being used and where optimizations can be made. Keep it DRY: Use interfaces and abstract types to reduce duplication in your schema.

By starting with core types and relationships, then gradually adding queries, mutations, and advanced features, we can build a schema that's both powerful and maintainable.  Remember, your schema is a living document. As your application evolves, so too will your schema. By following these principles and best practices, you'll be well-equipped to design and maintain a GraphQL schema that can grow with your needs.  The TechTalent example we've explored here demonstrates many real-world considerations, but every application will have its unique requirements. Always design with your specific use cases in mind, and don't be afraid to iterate as you learn more about how your API is used in practice.  By investing time in thoughtful schema design upfront, you'll create a solid foundation for your GraphQL API, enabling efficient development and a great experience for your API consumers.

This approach has several benefits over a monolithic architecture, including improved scalability, resilience, and maintainability. In a microservices architecture, each service has a specific role and is independently deployable, so developers can work on different services in parallel and deploy them independently of each other. This can make the development process more agile and allow for faster deployment of new features.    An API gateway is a server that acts as a single point of entry for certain types of requests. It can receive requests from the client, route them to the appropriate backend service, and then return the response from the backend service to the client. An API gateway can also perform tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching. This makes it a useful component in a microservices architecture, where each service has its API and the API gateway acts as the &quot;front door&quot; for clients to access the services.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"API Composition​","type":1,"pageTitle":"No one talks about API Orchestration","url":"/blog/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration/#api-composition","content":" API composition refers to the process of combining multiple APIs to create a new API or a new functionality. This can be done by sending requests to multiple APIs and combining the results, or by creating a new API that acts as a façade for the underlying APIs.  💡 API Composition is also known as API Orchestration. This is however vastly different from Microservice Orchestration.  For example, consider a scenario where a client application wants to display a user's profile information and recent posts on a social media platform. In this case, the client can send two separate requests to two different APIs: one to retrieve the user's profile information, and another to retrieve their recent posts. The client can then combine the results from these two APIs to create a single response that contains all the required information. This new response can be considered as the output of the composed API.  To build a rich user interface, API composition is necessary on the client side. One of the main challenges with API composition on the client side is that it can lead to increased complexity in the client application. This is because the client needs to handle the process of sending requests to multiple APIs and combining the results, which can add to the overall size and complexity of the client code.  Another challenge with API composition on the client side is that it can result in reduced performance and increased latency. This is because the client needs to make multiple separate requests to different APIs, which can take more time and result in a slower response from the composed API.  In addition, API composition on the client side can also lead to increased security risks. This is because the client needs to handle sensitive information, such as API keys and authentication credentials, which can be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured. The client doesn't have access to powerful CPUs or a reliable network either. This makes the composition problem even more challenging to implement and manage. It is therefore often more efficient and effective to perform API composition on the server side instead.

This can enable the BFF to perform API composition on behalf of the client, which can help to improve the performance and reliability of the composed API. The BFF layer typically sits as a separate component in the overall architecture, between the frontend client and the microservices. It can communicate with both the frontend client and the microservices using well-defined interfaces and protocols, such as REST or gRPC.  The BFF can take advantage of a powerful CPU and access to a fast network to improve the performance and reliability of the composed API. It can also provide added flexibility and control over the composition process. This can make it a useful tool for developers who want to create new APIs by combining the functionality of multiple underlying APIs.

Unlike an API gateway, there is no standard BFF solution that can be deployed out-of-the-box, and each BFF implementation must be custom-tailored to the specific requirements of the frontend client. This lack of standardization and reusability can make the BFF solution more complex and difficult to maintain.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Fragile​","type":1,"pageTitle":"No one talks about API Orchestration","url":"/blog/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration/#fragile","content":" Another challenge with using a BFF layer is that it can be fragile and susceptible to failure. The BFF solution is dependent on the developers to follow best practices and handle all error scenarios, and if these steps are not taken, the solution can be prone to bugs and performance issues. Additionally, the BFF solution must be thoroughly tested, including performance testing, unit testing, and integration testing, to ensure that it is reliable and performs well in production. This can require significant effort and expertise, and if these steps are not properly followed, the BFF solution can be fragile and prone to failure. Also, it's worth mentioning that a BFF layer is an entry point to all your backend, it going down basically means nothing is accessible for the user so this layer needs to be robust and resilient to exceptions.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Performance​","type":1,"pageTitle":"No one talks about API Orchestration","url":"/blog/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration/#performance","content":" Because BFF layers are typically custom-written for each use case, it can be difficult to predict the performance impact of a small code change. Issues such as unoptimized algorithms, inefficient caching, and unnecessary downstream requests can go unnoticed and only be discovered very late in the development cycle.

However, in practice, this architecture sometimes creates friction within the organization, particularly when BFFs are developed and maintained by the backend team. Here are a few reasons why:  Communication and Responsiveness: As the backend team is typically in charge of the BFF, front-end teams often have to wait for them to make necessary changes. This slows down the development process, especially when backlogs are high or priorities differ. Different Skillsets: Backend and frontend developers often specialize in different programming languages and paradigms. If the backend team is in charge of the BFF, they might not be as comfortable or efficient at dealing with issues that are more closely related to the frontend. Lack of Ownership: Frontend teams often feel that they lack ownership and control over the part of the system that directly impacts their work. This leads to decreased motivation and productivity.  One potential solution to these issues is to shift the ownership of the BFFs to the front-end teams. Since these teams are the primary consumers of the BFFs, they could be better placed to design, implement, and maintain them. This would not only empower the front-end teams but also free up backend teams to focus on their core responsibilities.  However, this solution is not without its own challenges. For one, front-end teams would need to upskill to handle their new responsibilities. Also, the organization would need to ensure that there are clear lines of communication between the front-end and backend teams, so that any changes to shared resources can be coordinated effectively.

Moreover, it's not very clear if we use an API gateway with a BFF layer, where should we place it? Should we place it between the clients and the BFF layer or the BFF layer and the service mesh? These are subjective decisions that each company ends up making as there is no standard way of doing this. However, it's worth mentioning that legacy gateways do introduce a gap that's being attempted to be filled by a BFF layer.  BFF, Presentation Layer, Facade, Middleware, UI Layer, Orchestration Layer, API Adapter — Are all different nomenclatures used for the same thing.  To summarize, BFFs do indeed address the issues of API orchestration to a significant extent; however, they also present a new set of challenges for organizations to tackle.

With GraphQL, the ability to request only needed fields can significantly reduce payload sizes. For example, if you're building a mobile app that displays a list of products, you might only need the product name, price, and thumbnail image. In a REST API, you might get all product details including lengthy descriptions, inventory data, etc. This extra data increases the payload size and parsing time on mobile devices.  Here's a concrete example:  REST API response (over-fetching):  { &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Smartphone X&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 999.99, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A very long description...&quot;, &quot;inventory&quot;: 500, &quot;categoryId&quot;: 5, &quot;brandId&quot;: 3, &quot;specs&quot;: { ... }, &quot;reviews&quot;: [ ... ], &quot;relatedProducts&quot;: [ ... ] }   GraphQL query and response (precise data):  query { product(id: 1) { name price thumbnailUrl } }   { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;product&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Smartphone X&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 999.99, &quot;thumbnailUrl&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/thumb.jpg&quot; } } }   The GraphQL response is much smaller, leading to faster load times, especially on slower networks.  However, it's not all roses for GraphQL. Complex queries can put a heavier load on your database. For instance, a deeply nested query fetching users, their posts, comments on those posts, and information about the comment authors could result in multiple joins or separate database queries. This is where techniques like DataLoader (for batching and caching) become crucial in GraphQL implementations.  On the OpenAPI side, while over-fetching can be an issue, it also allows for easier caching at the network level (CDNs, reverse proxies) because the responses for a given URL are consistent. Additionally, for simple CRUD operations, the RESTful approach can be more straightforward to implement and may perform better out of the box.

Let's break this down:  GraphQL:  Learning Curve: While GraphQL concepts like schemas, resolvers, and the query language itself take time to master, tools like GraphiQL provide an interactive playground that significantly eases the learning process. Developers can explore the API, auto-complete queries, and see instant results. Tailcall offers a cost-effective solution for migrating to GraphQL. Which easily integrates with your existing REST/gRPC APIs and provides a seamless transition to GraphQL, smoothing the learning curve for developers. Tooling: The GraphQL ecosystem has evolved rapidly. Tools like Apollo Client not only help with querying but also provide powerful caching mechanisms, state management, and optimistic UI updates. Here's a quick example of how Apollo Client simplifies data fetching in React: const GET_USER = gql` query GetUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name email } } ` function UserProfile({userId}) { const {loading, error, data} = useQuery(GET_USER, { variables: {id: userId}, }) if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt; if (error) return &lt;p&gt;Error :(&lt;/p&gt; return &lt;h1&gt;{data.user.name}&lt;/h1&gt; }   This declarative approach to data fetching can significantly simplify frontend code.  Type Safety: GraphQL's strong typing, when combined with tools like TypeScript, can provide end-to-end type safety from your API to your frontend code, catching errors at compile time.  OpenAPI:  Familiarity: For developers already versed in REST principles, OpenAPI feels like a natural extension. Its structure mirrors typical REST endpoints, making it easier to adopt in existing projects. Code Generation: One of OpenAPI's strengths is the ability to generate both server and client code. For example, using a tool like Swagger Codegen, you can generate a fully functional API client in multiple languages from your OpenAPI spec. This can dramatically speed up development and reduce inconsistencies between API documentation and implementation. Standardization: OpenAPI's widespread adoption means that many cloud platforms and API gateways natively support OpenAPI specifications. For instance, Azure API Management can import an OpenAPI spec and automatically set up routing, request validation, and even mock responses for testing.  In practice, the choice often comes down to the specific needs of your project and team. GraphQL shines in scenarios with complex, interconnected data and when you need a flexible, powerful query language. OpenAPI excels in scenarios where you need a clear, standards-based approach, especially when working with external partners or in highly regulated environments.  Comparing the Ease of Adoption​  GraphQL: Flexibility and Complexity: GraphQL’s flexibility in querying data can be initially overwhelming for developers accustomed to REST. Learning to structure queries, manage resolvers, and handle errors can take time.Resources: Extensive resources, tutorials, and documentation are available, but hands-on experience is crucial for mastering GraphQL. OpenAPI: Structured and Predictable: OpenAPI’s structured approach is familiar to developers experienced with REST APIs.

When these queries become large, they can lead to increased latency and network usage, degrading client performance.  For example, a normal GraphQL query might look like this:  curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\ --data '{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;{ largeQuery { field1 field2 ... } }&quot;}' \\ http://your-graphql-server.com/graphql   Each GraphQL query is parsed every time the server receives it. If it's large, the parsing can take a significant amount of time, increasing latency even further.  Legacy Infrastructure​  Existing CDN infrastructure is designed to cache only GET calls. To make a GraphQL request, one must make a POST call. This limits the usage of CDNs for caching purposes.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Solution: Persisted Queries (PQ)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The truth about scaling Automatic Persisted Queries","url":"/blog/the-truth-about-scaling-automatic-persisted-queries/#solution-persisted-queries-pq","content":" Definition and Benefits​  To enhance network performance for large query strings, GraphQL server supports Persisted Queries (PQ). A PQ is a GraphQL query cached server-side, identified by its SHA-256 hash. Clients send this identifier instead of the query, dramatically reducing request sizes (without affecting response), saving parsing time, and enabling GET calls instead of POST.  A PQ request might look like this:  curl -X GET -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\ --data-urlencode 'extensions={&quot;persistedQuery&quot;:{&quot;version&quot;:1,&quot;sha256Hash&quot;:&quot;&lt;SHA 256&gt;&quot;}}' \\ http://your-graphql-server.com/graphql   Application with CDNs​  Using the PQ link automatically sends short hashed queries as GET requests, enabling CDNs to serve them.  Latency Reduction​  No Parsing Overhead: Since the query isn't sent to the server, the parsing stage, which can be computationally expensive, is eliminated. This saves valuable server processing time, directly reducing client latency. Network Efficiency: By transmitting only the hash instead of the full query, the request size is dramatically reduced, leading to faster network transmission and lower latency.  Security Enhancements​  Control Over Allowed Queries: The server can start with a finite set of &quot;allowed&quot; queries, ensuring that unauthorized or unoptimized GraphQL requests cannot be made. This control is a significant safeguard for production environments, preventing potential abuse or inefficiencies. Reduction in Attack Surface: By limiting the queries to a pre-defined set, the risk of malicious queries is reduced, enhancing the security profile of the application.  Problem​  While PQs provide remarkable benefits, they are not without challenges:  Schema Rigidity: If you aim to keep the schema open and queries dynamic, supporting any possible query becomes complex.

In a PQ setup, the server runs with a known set of queries, meaning client changes require server updates. This has implications for maintenance costs, particularly in supporting multiple versions of queries and making a server deployment for every change in the client query. APQs were introduced to overcome these challenges.  How APQs Work​  The APQ process is a two-step approach:  Hash Request: The client sends a request with the hash of the query. If the server recognizes the hash, it returns the corresponding response: curl -X GET -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\ --data-urlencode 'extensions={&quot;persistedQuery&quot;:{&quot;version&quot;:1,&quot;sha256Hash&quot;:&quot;&lt;SHA 256&gt;&quot;}}' \\ http://your-graphql-server.com/graphql Full Query Request: If the server does not recognize the hash, it returns an error. The client then sends a new request that includes both the hash and the full query string: curl --get http://localhost:4000/graphql \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --data-urlencode '{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;{ largeQuery { field1 field2 ... } }&quot;}' \\ --data-urlencode 'extensions={&quot;persistedQuery&quot;:{&quot;version&quot;:1,&quot;sha256Hash&quot;:&quot;&lt;HASH&gt;&quot;}}' The server parses the full query, caches it for future use, and returns the GraphQL response. Subsequent requests use the hash.  This process optimizes network performance while allowing flexibility in the queries that can be run.

Now, multiple clients send hash requests for queries that are not yet cached.  Massive Error Responses: Since the cache is empty, the server returns errors for all hash requests, signaling the clients to send the full query strings. Simultaneous Full Query Requests: All clients now simultaneously send full query requests, causing a sudden surge in demand. Server Strain: The server must parse and cache each unique query, placing significant strain on its resources. This can lead to increased latency and even server failure if the demand is too high. Repeated Pattern: If the server struggles to cache the queries quickly enough, the clients may continue to receive errors and retry the full query requests, perpetuating the problem.  In an environment with many clients and dynamically changing queries, the system can become vulnerable to sudden surges in demand. This vulnerability can undermine the performance benefits APQs are designed to provide, leading to potential system instability.  Cache Limitations​  Queries are typically cached in memory, requiring cache warmup on each instance, hindering deployment on server-less solutions. An alternative could be using a centralized cache, but it typically nullifies performance gains due to serialization, deserialization, and IO call overhead.  Security Concerns​  Automatically persisting queries can cause memory leaks, as clients can send varying query combinations, exhausting server memory.

In essence, it's about abstracting multiple data sources or services into a unified, single API interface that can be consumed by clients. This approach is not unique to any particular technology or framework and can be implemented with various tools and languages.  However, GraphQL has played a significant role in popularizing the concept of federation. With its strong typing, introspective capabilities, and its natural fit for defining schemas across distributed services, it has provided an elegant solution to the challenge of federating APIs.  While this blog discusses federation in the context of GraphQL, it's essential to understand that the core principles and challenges of the federation can be applied beyond GraphQL. Remember, the implementation of federation is not about a specific technology, but about the architectural approach to create a unified interface from multiple data sources.  With this in mind, let's delve into the pros and cons of the federation, using GraphQL as our main context for the discussion. As you'll see, the benefits and pitfalls of federation are relevant, whether you're using GraphQL or not.  Federation is a concept that originates from the philosophy of microservices. This approach promotes the partitioning of large monolithic systems into smaller, more manageable components. In a federated architecture, instead of having a monolithic Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) handling all requests, you have multiple smaller BFFs that handle different aspects of the request.  Imagine a client makes a request to your system. This request still goes through an API gateway, which serves as the entry point to your system. However, instead of hitting a monolithic BFF, it now meets a BFF Router, specifically designed to understand and route requests to the appropriate BFFs.  The Router is smart. It understands the client's request and can break it down into smaller parts. It then delegates these smaller tasks to the appropriate services, each responsible for a specific aspect of the request. These services work in parallel, handling their part of the request, which often involves calling downstream microservices and orchestrating their responses.  Once the BFFs have finished their tasks, they send their responses back to the Router. The Router, in turn, takes these individual responses, combines them into a single response that fulfils the original request, and sends it back to the client.  This system, where individual services handle specific parts of a request in a coordinated manner, is often referred to as a Federation. The term &quot;Apollo Federation&quot; or &quot;Super Graph&quot; is commonly used to describe this setup when it's implemented with Apollo, a popular GraphQL implementation, but the concept is not limited to any specific technology or tool.    ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Federation Benefits​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Unraveling the Challenges of BFF Federation","url":"/blog/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation/#federation-benefits","content":" Many large organizations using GraphQL in production have transitioned to this architecture to accommodate their scaling needs. The primary selling points of this architecture are:  Enhanced Team Ownership: GraphQL Federation fosters a sense of ownership among teams by allowing each team to own and maintain its GraphQL service. With Federation, teams can operate independently, focusing on their specific domain without worrying about the overall schema. This separation of concerns leads to more maintainable code, faster development cycles, and increased productivity. It empowers teams to work in parallel, each owning a piece of the larger schema while ensuring that the entire system operates as a cohesive whole. This significantly enhances team efficiency and collaboration, particularly in larger organizations with multiple teams working on different services. This alone is by far the most significant aspect of using GraphQL Federation. Incremental Adoption: A major advantage of GraphQL Federation is its ability to support incremental adoption. This means teams can gradually wrap their domain-specific microservices with a GraphQL layer, one at a time, and integrate it into the federated schema without disrupting the entire system. This flexible approach minimizes the impact on existing workflows and reduces the risks associated with large-scale changes. From the frontend perspective, GraphQL Federation offers a unified interface for querying the data. This simplifies the frontend code and enables the development of rich, interactive UIs with less effort. As soon as the first services are federated, frontend developers can begin transitioning their queries to the federated schema, reducing disruption and allowing for a smoother adoption process. This incremental approach also allows teams to evaluate and demonstrate the value of federation at each step, building confidence and promoting buy-in across the organization. It ensures teams are not overwhelmed by the complexity of new technology or architecture and can adjust their practices as they learn.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Federation vs BFF​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Unraveling the Challenges of BFF Federation","url":"/blog/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation/#federation-vs-bff","content":"   It's not hard to see that GraphQL Federation carries some serious muscle over its monolithic adversary, the BFF. But before we declare a champion, let's take a few rounds to scrutinize the limitations we've come across in our BFF solution, and see how the GraphQL Federation stands up under pressure. It's time for a head-to-head comparison!  Specialization: Both BFF and GraphQL Federation require a certain amount of manual intervention. In the BFF approach, the entire layer is custom-built, meaning there's no ready-to-use solution, which necessitates significant manual management. On the other hand, GraphQL Federation provides an open-source, ready-to-use Apollo Router. However, it's not an all-inclusive solution, as the individual GraphQL services still need to be manually maintained and written by hand for specific use cases. While it's still a tough fight, the federation manages to land a jab here and gets a few extra points in this round. Fragility: Federation offers an enhanced strategy. In a federated architecture, when a GraphQL service malfunction, only its segment of the graph becomes inaccessible to the user. This results in a more resilient system, less prone to total failure, demonstrating the ability to continue the fight even after taking a hit. In this round, Federation steps up and delivers a solid punch. Performance: When it comes to Performance, the Federation architecture introduces an extra journey for each packet. The request has to travel through the router, then to the individual GraphQL services, before finally reaching the domain service. This journey can add a few milliseconds of latency, a difference that may not be perceptible to the end user. However, this seemingly small delay has a broader impact on the performance of the entire architecture. The addition of the router introduces a requirement for more infrastructure and increases the frequency of data serialization and deserialization. This increased complexity affects both the system's throughput and infrastructure costs. In this round, the Federation architecture might not be the clear knockout winner we were hoping for. Monolith Tendency: It's a clear knockout in this round for the Federation! It elegantly sidesteps the monolith tendency, keeping the architecture agile and modular. BFF, in contrast, takes a heavy fall with its tendency to become a monolithic layer over time. Canary Release: Federation, unlike BFF, reveals graph dependencies and compatibility issues at runtime, not compile time. This amps up the need for first-class canary releases. However, when it comes to canary support, it's a draw. Both fighters are still in the ring, each showing resilience in their own way. No knockout here, folks! Coupled Release: In the Federation architecture, each GraphQL service operates independently, significantly reducing the coupling between services and the router. This independence allows each team to manage its own release cycles, putting an end to the wide-scale halts that were commonplace with the BFF layer. However, it's important to note that each GraphQL service still maintains a tight connection with its corresponding downstream domain service. While this is a form of coupling, it's considerably less invasive than the BFF approach, where the entire layer was intertwined. Despite this necessary connection to the domain services, the Federation architecture proves to be more agile. In this round, GraphQL Federation edges out the BFF approach. Organizational Friction: With Federation, the responsibility for managing the architecture often falls squarely on the shoulders of backend engineers. The reason is simple: the complexity of the architecture and its intimate ties with downstream domain services necessitate a deep level of technical understanding. This is a departure from the BFF paradigm, where frontend teams could claim ownership of this part of the infrastructure. The intricate nature of the Federation, however, makes this almost untenable. When put head-to-head with BFFs, the Federation seems to take a step back in this regard. The power to control abstraction slips away from the consumer. In this round, BFFs manage to hold their ground. Legacy Gateway: Just as in the BFF model, the API gateway maintains its place in the Federation architecture, and rightfully so. However, we find ourselves reestablishing a substantial amount of resiliency and caching logic within these new layers, duplicating efforts previously expended on a traditional gateway. This redundancy marks a lack of efficiency in the Federation approach, signaling a tie in this round.  Overall, this round favors GraphQL Federation. It proves to be a significantly more robust architecture when evaluated based on the aforementioned criteria. Let's explore further and assess how it performs in isolation and as the company expands.

Here are some points of caution that should be considered when deciding to use this architecture:  Cost and Complexity: GraphQL Federation introduces significant complexity into the architecture. Setting up, maintaining, and testing a federated graph can be a challenge as it requires a deep understanding of both GraphQL and distributed systems. Additionally, this architecture demands more infrastructure and a larger team for maintenance. As such, the adoption and migration process can be complex and costly. Typically, only large organizations with platform teams, robust budgets, and a governing body to maintain the schema's sanctity and system reliability, tend to consider adopting this approach. The inherent complexity and cost implications make the Federation a less likely choice for small to medium-sized organizations. Ownership Challenges: It is often argued that domain service owners maintain their individual GraphQL layers. However, this doesn't always reflect the reality. Services can frequently be divided or merged, leading to uncertainty about how to modify the GraphQL layer. This results in a complex web of requests from GraphQL services to domain services outside the team's control. Infrastructure Scaling: Each subgraph in a federated architecture operates on a separate piece of infrastructure, scaling independently. This brings its own set of challenges. For instance, when a subgraph is divided or merged, computing and scaling requirements need to be re-evaluated. Moreover, a deployment in another subgraph can trigger a substantial increase in load from the router on your subgraph, potentially causing unexpected stress on your infrastructure. This underscores the need for robust scaling and load-balancing strategies within a federated architecture.  While GraphQL Federation has the potential to solve some issues of traditional BFF architecture, it brings in its own set of challenges.

As long as the output of your backend matches what's expected in the query, the specification doesn't care about how the backend is implemented.  Hence, the main complexity with GraphQL comes with how GraphQL is built. One of the major hurdles in hand-coding a GraphQL backend is managing performance. Issues like batching, incorrect usage of data loaders, caching, and the notorious N+1 problem can cripple your application.  Manually implementing batching mechanisms and data loaders can be incredibly tedious. While libraries like DataLoader can assist, integrating them seamlessly into your system requires a deep understanding of both your data and the GraphQL query patterns. Overuse of data loaders is so common with most GraphQL implementations that ultimately it becomes the main culprit for high latency.  Secondly, traditional caching doesn't work with GraphQL, so you have to resort to all sorts of solutions, using persisted queries or some vendor-specific implementation of caching. Implementing effective caching strategies is essential for performance but it's tricky. Developers must decide what to cache, when to invalidate the cache, and how to manage cache consistency, which adds another layer of complexity.  The N+1 issue, boy, that's perhaps everyone's favorite issue with GraphQL. It arises when executing multiple upstream requests that could have been combined into one, leading to massive performance degradation. Detecting and solving this requires meticulous analysis of query patterns and database access, which requires developers to have the context of the whole query at once, generate a query plan, translate it to appropriate upstream calls, and then execute! That's a lot of complex engineering effort; building a general-purpose query engine is not for the faint-hearted, and in the midst of all this complex yet interesting work, I need to ship features!  Grafast is an upcoming generalized query planner that could make query-planning in JS a bit more tamed.  GraphQL’s flexibility can be a double-edged sword when it comes to security, necessitating robust mechanisms for authentication and authorization. Like caching, traditional route-based API access doesn't work with GraphQL. Implementing these security layers correctly involves ensuring that only authenticated users can access the GraphQL entity and that they can only access data or fields that they are authorized to see. This requires fine-grained control and often custom logic and the invention of a new standard that works just for you.  Lastly, but most importantly, ensuring your GraphQL API is reliable means tackling error handling, propagation, and telemetry. Proper error handling in GraphQL is crucial for providing meaningful feedback to clients and maintaining the integrity of your application. The GraphQL team recently started working on a standard for serving GraphQL over HTTP, which won't be easy to integrate if you already have a GraphQL API running in production. Moreover, integrating telemetry within a GraphQL backend isn't easy either; it is a very involved process to integrate spans to trace GraphQL resolvers. And, if you have written your GraphQL layer by hand in JavaScript, be ready for some significant performance degradation.

I would argue that SQL is a closer elder sibling of GraphQL than REST or gRPC. Writing a GraphQL backend can be likened to building an SQL engine manually. Imagine if every time you wanted to interact with a database, you had to write the SQL engine from scratch. Every time you made a database change, you would need to rewrite your engine so that it can work with the new schema or indexes. It’s inefficient and impractical; no one does that. Fortunately, modern databases come with embedded, high-performance SQL engines such as Apache Calcite that adhere to the SQL specification but abstract away the complexities around building it. These databases allow developers to focus on writing queries and managing data without worrying about the underlying mechanics, thanks to their sophisticated query engines.  GraphQL, much like SQL, is a query language designed to allow clients to request exactly the data they need. Unlike REST, which relies on fixed endpoints, or gRPC, which focuses on remote procedure calls, GraphQL provides a flexible, hierarchical way to fetch and manipulate data, making it a closer analog to SQL in terms of expressiveness and precision. And I believe the future of GraphQL is going to be like the journey of this elder sibling.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"The future of GraphQL​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing a GraphQL Backend by Hand is Long Gone","url":"/blog/writing-a-graphql-backend-by-hand-is-long-gone/#the-future-of-graphql","content":" The future of GraphQL development is moving towards generalized automated solutions built on modern, low-level system stacks like Rust and Zig, and moving away from the prevalent hand-written Node.js-based solutions of today.    These engines will connect to data sources of any type and build a GraphQL endpoint on top of them. They will find connections between other data sources, sometimes completely automatically and sometimes using hints given by the developer, creating a unified GraphQL experience. Similar to SQL engines, which use JIT techniques to identify performance optimizations at runtime, GraphQL engines will become extremely smart about performance. My hope is that GraphQL will eventually move away from its dependency on the JSON protocol, into something more efficient such as protobuf. There is definitely going to be a lot of work put into the standardization of the loose ends. GraphQL engines will eventually converge on error handling and error propagation strategies. GraphQL on HTTP is the first step in that direction. Authentication and Authorization too will very quickly become standard features of GraphQL, so you won't need to worry about inventing a new way of authentication. This will all be packed into a GraphQL standard. This might be a stretch, but if the standards team gets together, I think even GraphQL caching will be consistent across all GraphQL engines, and you will be able to switch from one caching solution to another without locking into a vendor-specific implementation.  You might have already seen a wave of open-source solutions that build GraphQL on top of existing data sources. One such solution paving the way is Tailcall. Tailcall’s platform is designed to automate the creation, validation, and optimization of GraphQL backends. Sticking to standards and ensuring developers don't ever have to pay the heavy tax of using GraphQL that they do today, do check it out!  Lastly, if you are reading this today and thinking of writing a GraphQL server by hand, I urge you to reconsider and use something that does this for you. Before you know it, your handwritten solution will be deprecated in favor of something faster, easier, and more secure: an automatic GraphQL solution.

This has many benefits, and we have talked about them in our previous blog.  One of the main advantages of not handwriting is the ability to introspect and optimize. Let's take an example of two functions written in Rust, though the problem is evident in all general purpose programming languages.  const BASE_URL: &amp;str = &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; // Describes a typical Post returned from the /posts API struct Post { id: i32, user_id: i32 title: String, body: String, user: Option&lt;User&gt; } // Describes a typical User object from the /users API struct User { id: i32 name: String, email: String } // Asynchronously retrieves a `User` object by making a GET request using the given `user_id`. async fn get_user(user_id: i32) -&gt; User { let response = request(Method::GET, format!(&quot;{}/users/{}&quot;, BASE_URL, user_id)).await; // Decode the body as a User decode(response.body) } // Asynchronously fetches and updates posts with user details from the API. async fn get_posts() -&gt; Vec&lt;Post&gt; { let response = request(Method::GET, format!(&quot;{}/posts&quot;, BASE_URL)).await; // Decode the response into a Vec&lt;Post&gt; let mut posts = decode(response.body) // Set the actual user by making an HTTP call for post in posts { post.user = Some(get_user(post.user_id).await); } posts }   You might have identified that there are few issues in the implementation above:  For each post item we end up making a call for the user independently, there is a clear N+1 issue here.It's possible that two posts can be written by the same user, and yet we will end up making duplicate calls for the same user.All calls to the /users API is being made in sequence, even though they can be paralyzed.There are multiple points of failure which the above code doesn't handle.  Now, yes all of these issues can be solved by better coding practices, using a Result type and using a DataLoader but that's besides the point. The point here is - Semantic analysis of any code is critical to building a robust systems and is only possible with some sort of human intervention typically in the form of code reviews or perhaps using some LLM if you are into that hype. What you can't do is - Write an algorithm to identify the N+1 issue in your GraphQL implementation that 100% accurate.  With a configuration its a completely different story, take the below Tailcall configuration for example:  schema @upstream( baseURL: &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; ) { query: Query } type Query { posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: ID! userId: ID! title: String! body: String! user: User @http(path: &quot;/users{{.value.userId}}&quot;) } type User { id: ID name: String email: String }   It's simple, expressive and doesn't expose the guts of how data will be queried, batched, deduped, parsed etc. Sure, configurations take away flexibility from writing anything but in return it liberates you from a ton of such nitty gritties of building a robust software system. The above configuration file can be parsed, validated and semantically analyzed accurately to identify issues such as N+1 very precisely using the check command as follows:    ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"The Algorithm​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How Tailcall statically identifies N+1 issues in GraphQL","url":"/blog/tailcall-n+1-identification-algorithm/#the-algorithm","content":" Tailcall reads your configuration, parses it, and internally stores it in an efficient graph data-structure that resembles a HashMap. This allows O(1) access to a GraphQL type which represented as a node by its name. Once the graph data-structure is ready we make it go through a series of validators, one of them being the N+1 tracker.  Now, here's where it gets fascinating. We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, starting at the root query and traversing all the connected nodes. Let me walk you through this cool process:  Initialize two variables to track the currently traversed path and visited fields so that we can avoid cycles.Start at the root query and begin traversing the graph data structure.For each field in the current node, check if it has a resolver and is not batched. We know if the node contains a resolver if that node has a @http or a @grpc. Tailcall supports powerful batching primitives and if a field uses a Batch API, then that resolver is whitelisted and dropped from the list of potential N+1 candidates.If the field has a resolver and is not batched, and the current path contains a list, then the current path is added to the result.Otherwise, we recursively traverse the graph data structure, updating the current path and visited fields as necessary.If a cycle is detected, return the cached result instead of re-traversing the path.Once the traversal is complete, return the result, which represents the identified N+1 issues.  This algorithm allows Tailcall to efficiently identify potential N+1 issues across your entire GraphQL schema, even in complex, deeply nested structures.  tip To see the actual implementation you can check out the tracker.rs implementation.

All this while our team has been focused on benchmarking and optimizing the runtime performance of the server.

You can clearly see that we don't actually perform an append or a concat operation instead we store a representation of that operation. This is a significant optimization because while performing the DFS, we create a lot of temporary query paths.

Browsers lack the necessary APIs to provide fine-grained control over requests. For instance:  There's no way to enforce the use of HTTP/2.Even if HTTP/2 could be enforced, browsers can't access raw HTTP/2 frames.  To address these limitations, the gRPC-Web specification was developed. It builds upon the HTTP/2 spec but introduces key differences:  Support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols.A new method for handling gRPC trailers: Trailers are sent at the very end of request/response bodies.A new bit in the gRPC message header indicates the presence of trailers. Requirement of a proxy server: This proxy translates between gRPC-Web requests and standard gRPC HTTP/2 responses.It's a mandatory component in the gRPC-Web architecture.  These adaptations allow gRPC-like functionality in web browsers while working within current browser constraints.  gRPC is powerful for service to service communication, but it may not be the best choice for public APIs or browser-based applications where REST/GraphQL is more prevalent.  tip To seamlessly integrate the benefits of both gRPC and GraphQL, you can easily generate GraphQL from gRPC using Tailcall.

Integration with OpenTelemetry allows for the automatic transfer of this data to the OpenTelemetry system. This layered approach ensures that the tracing library, which is effective across various scenarios, can also function as a standalone telemetry system for logging when OpenTelemetry integration is not required. When developing any features that necessitate observability, consider the following guidelines: Implement traces for tasks that represent a significant operation. This practice aids in the efficient diagnosis of issues and performance bottlenecks.Name spans clearly and specifically, adhering to the guidelines outlined in the OpenTelemetry specifications. Avoid names that introduce a high cardinality of potential values.Due to the constraints of tracing libraries, span names must be static strings. This limitation can be overcome by adding an extra field named otel.name to provide more dynamic descriptions (see the tracing-opentelemetry documentation for more details).Attribute naming should follow OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions.

This process adds latency and increases system resources. Limited Ports on Client Side: A unique combination of an IP address and a port number is necessary for each TCP connection from a client. With each new connection, the IP remains the same because the client is the same, but a new port gets used. The number of available ports on a machine is 65535. These ports get shared among all processes, and not all are available for use. Excessive creation of new connections can lead to port exhaustion on the client side, preventing new connections and causing system failures across running processes. tip Use lsof and netstat commands to check the ports to process mapping.  Connection pooling mitigates these issues by reusing existing connections for requests, reducing connection establishment frequency (and thus handshake overhead) and conserving client-side ports. This approach enhances application performance by minimizing the resources and time spent on managing connections.

You might need to further tune the HTTP client to improve your application's performance. Tailcall DSL provides a directive named @upstream for this purpose.  note Connection pooling optimizes HTTP/1. Since HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support multiplexing, pooling enabled does not noticeably affect performance.

Example:  schema @upstream( poolMaxIdlePerHost: 60 ) { query: Query }   Too idle connections can unnecessarily consume memory and ports, while too few might cause delays as new connections need frequent establishment. poolMaxIdlePerHost ensures judicious use of network and memory resources, avoiding wastage on seldom-used connections.  For applications connecting to hosts, set this value lower to keep connections available for other hosts. Conversely, if you have hosts and all requests must resolve through them, maintain a higher value for this setting.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"tcpKeepAlive​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Optimizing Performance of your GraphQL Server","url":"/docs/graphql-client-performance-tuning/#tcpkeepalive","content":" tcpKeepAlive keeps TCP connections alive for a duration, during inactivity, by periodically sending packets to the server to check if the connection remains open. In connection pooling, tcpKeepAlive maintains reusable connections in a ready-to-use state. This setting is useful for long-lived connections, preventing -lived connections, preventing the client from using a connection the server has closed due to inactivity. Without tcpKeepAlive, connections in the pool might get dropped by the server or intermediate network devices (like firewalls or load balancers). When your client tries to use such a dropped connection, it would fail, causing delays and errors. Keeping connections alive and monitored means you can efficiently reuse them, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections frequently.  Tailcall provides a parameter named tcpKeepAlive for the upstream which defaults to 5 seconds.

When making a connection request, the client tries to resolve the DNS, complete the SSL handshake, and establish a TCP connection. In environments where pods are frequently created and destroyed, maintaining a low connectTimeout is crucial to avoid unnecessary delays. In systems using connection pooling, the system aborts the attempt if it cannot establish a connection within the connectTimeout period. This approach prevents indefinite waiting for a connection to establish, which could cause delays and timeouts.  Tailcall offers a connectTimeout parameter to set the connection timeout in seconds for the HTTP client, defaulting to 60 seconds. Example:  schema @upstream( connectTimeout: 10 ) { query: Query }   In summary, maximizing HTTP client performance requires understanding the underlying protocols and configuring client settings through testing.

To resolve this issue, consider marking root fields as protected in case they require authentication, i.e.:  schema { query: Query mutation: Mutation } type Query { user(id: Int!): User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.args.id}}&quot;) } type Mutation { user(id: Int!): User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.args.id}}&quot;, method: POST) @protected } type User { id: Int! name: String! website: String @protected }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Multiple auth providers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Field Level GraphQL Authentication","url":"/docs/field-level-access-control-graphql-authentication/#multiple-auth-providers","content":" In case you linked multiple authentication files all of them will be used to execute validation process.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Environment Variables​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Reading Environment Variables","url":"/docs/graphql-environment-variables/#environment-variables","content":" With Tailcall, you can seamlessly integrate environment variables into your GraphQL schema. Tailcall supports this through a env Context variable. All directives share this Context, allowing you to resolve values in your schema.  Example schema:  type Query { users: [User]! @http( baseUrl: &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; path: &quot;/users&quot; ) }   Here, we fetch a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API. The users field will contain the fetched value at runtime. This works fine, but what if we want to change the API endpoint? We would need to update the code and redeploy the application, which is cumbersome.  We can address this issue using environment variables. Replace the API endpoint with an environment variable, allowing us to change the variable's value without altering our codebase.  type Query { users: [User]! @http(baseUrl: &quot;{{env.API_ENDPOINT}}&quot;, path: &quot;/users&quot;) }   Here, you must set API_ENDPOINT as an environment variable on the device running your server. Upon startup, the server retrieves this value and makes it accessible through the env Context variable.  This approach allows us to change the API endpoint without modifying our codebase. For instance, we might use different API endpoints for development (stage-api.example.com) and production (api.example.com) environments.  Remember, environment variables are not limited to the baseUrl or @http directive. You can use them throughout your schema, as a Mustache template handles their evaluation.  Here's another example, using an environment variable in the headers of @grpc:  type Query { users: [User] @grpc( service: &quot;UserService&quot; method: &quot;ListUsers&quot; protoPath: &quot;./proto/user_service.proto&quot; baseURL: &quot;https://grpc-server.example.com&quot; headers: [ {key: &quot;X-API-KEY&quot;, value: &quot;{{.env.API_KEY}}&quot;} ] ) }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Security Aspects and Best Practices​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Reading Environment Variables","url":"/docs/graphql-environment-variables/#security-aspects-and-best-practices","content":" Environment variables help reduce security risks, but it's crucial to understand that they do not remove these risks entirely because the values are in plain text. Even if configuration values are not always highly sensitive, there is still a potential for compromising secrets. To ensure your secrets remain secure, consider the following tips:  Use a .env file: It's a common practice to create a .env file in your project's root directory for storing all environment variables. Avoid committing this file to your version control system; instead, add it to .gitignore to prevent public exposure of your secrets. For clarity and collaboration, maintain a .env.example file that enumerates all the necessary environment variables for your application, thereby guiding other developers on what variables they need to set. Within Tailcall (or in other environments), you can make use of this .env file by exporting its key-value pairs to your operating system. For example, if your .env file looks like this: API_ENDPOINT=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com Export it to your OS with: export $(cat .env | xargs) On Windows: Get-Content .env | Foreach-Object { [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($_.Split(&quot;=&quot;)[0], $_.Split(&quot;=&quot;)[1], &quot;User&quot;) } After this, you can access API_ENDPOINT in your codebase. Use Kubernetes Secrets: When deploying your application with Kubernetes, use its Secrets feature to manage environment variables. This approach ensures your secrets remain private and are not embedded in your codebase, while also making it easier to update values as necessary. Store Secrets Through Cloud Provider GUIs: For deployments using a cloud provider, use their GUI for environment variable management. These interfaces are intuitive and practical for containerized applications that automatically scale.  Following these practices ensures effective and secure management of your environment variables.

Enabling it requires setting the httpCache parameter to integer value which is greater than 0 in the @upstream configuration.

By default, this feature is disabled (false), meaning Tailcall will not modify or add Cache-Control headers unless explicitly instructed to do so. This setting is distinct from the general HTTP cache setting, which controls whether responses are cached internally by Tailcall; cacheControl specifically controls the caching instructions sent to clients.

These caching primitives are beneficial for REST APIs that are latency-sensitive, have a high rate of request repetition, or come with explicit caching headers indicating cacheable responses. Together, they tackle the common challenges of optimizing REST API performance by minimizing unnecessary network traffic and server load while ensuring response accuracy.  To further enhance the performance of any API with Tailcall, integrating the @cache directive offers protocol agnostic control over caching at the field level within a GraphQL schema.

To generate the required certificates (cert.pem and key.pem) OpenSSL is a widely used option. Here are the steps to get started with SSL:  Install OpenSSL: Download and install OpenSSL from its official website if it's not already installed on your system. Generate Private Key openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048 This creates a 2048-bit RSA private key, storing it in a file named key.pem. Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem You will be prompted to provide information for the certificate, such as the Common Name (CN), organization details, and locality. This information is embedded into the CSR, saved in a file named csr.pem. This file can be used to request a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) or generate a self-signed certificate. Generate Self-Signed Certificate openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem This generates a self-signed certificate valid for 365 days using the CSR from step 3 and the private key from step 2. The validity period can be adjusted by changing the number of days (-days). A &quot;Signature ok&quot; prompt confirms the successful creation. Cleanup Intermediate Files rm csr.pem After using the CSR to generate the self-signed certificate (cert.pem), the CSR file (csr.pem) becomes redundant. This step removes intermediate files created during the certificate generation process.  tip Use self-signed certificates for HTTP/2 configurations in development environments.

To do this we need to specify GraphQL types corresponding to gRPC types we have defined in the protobuf file. Let's create a new file grpc.graphql file with the following content:  # The GraphQL representation for News message type type News { id: Int title: String body: String postImage: String } # Input type that is used to fetch news data by its id input NewsInput { id: Int } # Resolves multiple news entries type NewsData { news: [News]! }   Now when we have corresponding types in schema we want to define GraphQL Query that specifies the operation we can execute onto news. We can extend our config with the next Query:  type Query { # Get all news i.e. NewsService.GetAllNews news: NewsData! # Get single news by id i.e. NewsService.GetNews newsById(news: NewsInput!): News! }   Also, let's specify options for Tailcall's ingress and egress at the beginning of the config using @server and @upstream directives.  schema @server(port: 8000) @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://localhost:50051&quot; httpCache: 42 ) { query: Query }   To specify the protobuf file to read types from, use the @link directive with the type Protobuf on the schema. id is an important part of the definition that will be used by the @grpc directive later  schema @link(id: &quot;news&quot;, src: &quot;./news.proto&quot;, type: Protobuf)   Now you can connect GraphQL types to gRPC types. To do this you may want to explore more about @grpc directive. Its usage is pretty straightforward and requires you to specify the path to a method that should be used to make a call. The method name will start with the package name, followed by the service name and the method name, all separated by the . symbol.  If you need to provide any input to the gRPC method call you can specify it with the body option that allows you to specify a Mustache template and therefore it could use any input data like args and value to construct the body request. The body value is specified in the JSON format if you need to create the input manually and cannot use args input.  type Query { news: NewsData! @grpc(method: &quot;news.news.NewsService.GetAllNews&quot;) newsById(news: NewsInput!): News! @grpc( service: &quot;news.news.NewsService.GetNews&quot; body: &quot;{..args.news}}&quot; ) }   Wrapping up the whole result config that may look like this:  # file: app.graphql schema @server(port: 8000) @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://localhost:50051&quot; httpCache: 42 ) @link(id: &quot;news&quot;, src: &quot;./news.proto&quot;, type: Protobuf) { query: Query } type Query { news: NewsData! @grpc(method: &quot;news.news.NewsService.GetAllNews&quot;) newsById(news: NewsInput!): News! @grpc( method: &quot;news.news.NewsService.GetNews&quot; body: &quot;{{.args.news}}&quot; ) } type News { id: Int title: String body: String postImage: String } input NewsInput { id: Int } type NewsData { news: [News]! }   Start the server by pointing it to the config.  tailcall start ./app.graphql   And now you can go to the page http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql and execute some GraphQL queries e.g.:  { news { news { id title body } } }   Or  { newsById(news: {id: 2}) { id title body } }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Batching​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building GraphQL over gRPC","url":"/docs/graphql-grpc-tailcall/#batching","content":" Another important feature of the @grpc directive is that it allows you to implement request batching for remote data almost effortlessly as soon as you have gRPC methods that resolve multiple responses for multiple inputs in a single request.

To enable batching we need to enable @upstream.batch option first and specify batchKey option for the @grpc directive.  schema @server(port: 8000) @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://localhost:50051&quot; httpCache: 42 batch: {delay: 10} ) @link(id: &quot;news&quot;, src: &quot;./news.proto&quot;, type: Protobuf) { query: Query } type Query { newsById(news: NewsInput!): News! @grpc( method: &quot;news.NewsService.GetNews&quot; body: &quot;{{.args.news}}&quot; batchKey: [&quot;news&quot;, &quot;id&quot;] ) }   Restart the GraphQL server and make the query with multiple news separately, e.g.:  { n1: newsById(news: {id: 1}) { id title body } n2: newsById(news: {id: 2}) { id title body } }   Those 2 requests will be executed inside a single request to the gRPC method GetMultipleNews  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Reflection​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building GraphQL over gRPC","url":"/docs/graphql-grpc-tailcall/#reflection","content":" gRPC reflection is a potent feature enabling clients to dynamically discover services and their methods at runtime.

Complexity in Detection: Identifying and resolving the N+1 problem can be challenging for developers, especially by merely examining GraphQL queries, schema or the server side resolver logic.

It allows direct querying of posts and, for each post, retrieves the associated author information. Similar to our curl requests above, when we query for posts and their authors using graphql query on client side given below we end up issuing multiple user calls upstream:  query { posts { id title user { id name email } } }   Let's examine the CLI output for this configuration with Tailcall's start command:  ❯ tailcall start ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql INFO File read: ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql ... ok INFO N+1 detected: 1 INFO 🚀 Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000] over HTTP/1.1 INFO 🌍 Playground: https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts HTTP/1.1 INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/8 HTTP/1.1 ...

This represents a significant productivity gain, as you can now identify all such N+1 issues upfront without resorting to complex profiling, tracing, or other runtime techniques. The check command also identifies the minimal query that could lead to these N+1 problems by performing semantic analysis of your configuration. With these powerful tools handy you can go about making extremely efficient GraphQL backends as we will see next:  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Using Batch APIs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Solving GraphQL N+1 Problem with Tailcall","url":"/docs/graphql-n-plus-one-problem-solved-tailcall/#using-batch-apis","content":"   An effective technique to mitigate the N+1 problem is deduplicating similar requests, significantly reducing the number of server calls. We achieved it previously using the dedupe setting. With Tailcall we can go one step further by giving hints about &quot;batch APIs&quot;.  Batch APIs: Are special APIs that allow us to query multiple things at once. In our case we can pass multiple user Ids as query params, to the /users API to resolve many users at once:  tip Try to hit /users?id=1&amp;id=2  TailCall provides the capability to leverage Batch APIs. To utilize this feature, edit the @http directive on Post.user field in your GraphQL schema as follows:  type Post { id: Int! userId: Int! title: String! body: String! user: User @http( path: &quot;/users&quot; query: [{key: &quot;id&quot;, value: &quot;{{.value.userId}}&quot;}] batchKey: [&quot;id&quot;] ) }   The described changes introduce two significant tweaks to the @http directive:  Addition of a query parameter: type Post { # ... user: User @http( path: &quot;/users&quot; query: [{key: &quot;id&quot;, value: &quot;{{.value.userId}}&quot;}] batchKey: [&quot;id&quot;] ) } This configuration generates a URL with the userId from the Post in the query params. For a batch of users, the CLI compiles a single URL, such as /users?id=1&amp;id=2&amp;id=3...id=10, consolidating the 10 requests into one. Addition of a batchKey: type Post { # ... user: User @http( path: &quot;/users&quot; query: [{key: &quot;id&quot;, value: &quot;{{.value.userId}}&quot;}] batchKey: [&quot;id&quot;] ) } This parameter instructs the system to use the user's id, in the User type, as the unique identifier. This helps in differentiating between users received from the batch API. When batchKey is present, Tailcall considers the first query parameter to be the batch query parameter, so remember to adjust the order of the items accordingly.  Let's see what the server logs when you now start Tailcall with the updated configuration:  schema @server(port: 8000) @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; ) { query: Query } type Query { posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: Int! userId: Int! title: String! body: String! user: User @http( path: &quot;/users&quot; query: [{key: &quot;id&quot;, value: &quot;{{.value.userId}}&quot;}] batchKey: [&quot;id&quot;] ) } type User { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! }   Let's start the server as usual and focus on the detected N+1 issues:  ❯ tailcall start ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql INFO File read: ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql ... ok INFO N+1 detected: 0 INFO 🚀 Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000] over HTTP/1.1 INFO 🌍 Playground: https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts HTTP/1.1 INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?id=1&amp;id=10&amp;id=2&amp;id=3&amp;id=4&amp;id=5&amp;id=6&amp;id=7&amp;id=8&amp;id=9 HTTP/1.1   As you can see there are ZERO N+1 detected this time!

The config generator provides a set of tuning parameters that can make the generated configurations more readable by reducing duplication and making configuration more readable. This can be configured using the preset section present in configuration.  JSONYML { &quot;preset&quot;: { &quot;mergeType&quot;: 0.8, &quot;consolidateURL&quot;: 0.8 } }   Let's understand how each of the parameter works.  mergeType:​ This setting merges types in the configuration that satisfy the threshold criteria. It takes a threshold value between 0.0 and 1.0 to determine if two types should be merged or not. The default is 1.0. MergeType also supports union types as well as interface types but merging of these types will happen only when they match exactly. Example 1: following types T1 and T2 are exactly similar, and with a threshold value of 1.0, they can be merged into a single type called M1: Merging type T1 and T2 into M1 Merging type T1 and T2 into M1 # BEFORE type T1 { id: ID firstName: String lastName: String } type T2 { id: ID firstName: String lastName: String } # AFTER: T1 and T2 are merged into M1. type M1 { id: ID firstName: String lastName: String } Example 2: following types T1 and T2 are similar with a threshold value of 0.5, they can be merged into a single type called M1: Merging type T1 and T2 into M1 Merging type T1 and T2 into M1 # BEFORE type T1 { id: ID firstName: String age: Int } type T2 { id: ID firstName: String lastName: String } # AFTER: T1 and T2 are merged into M1. type M1 { id: ID firstName: String lastName: String age: Int } Example 3: following types T1 and T2 are similar with a threshold value of 0.5 but we can't merge them as they have same field name but different types: Can't Merge type T1 and T2 as they've same field name but different type Can't Merge type T1 and T2 as they've same field name but different type # BEFORE type T1 { id: ID firstName: String age: Int } type T2 { id: ID firstName: String age: Float } Example 4: following types Foo and Bar will be merged into type M1 as they match exactly and same change will reflected in union type FooBar. Merging type Foo and Bar into M1 Merging type Foo and Bar into M1 # BEFORE type Foo { id: ID firstName: String age: Int } type Bar { id: ID firstName: String age: Int } union FooBar = Foo | Bar # After merging type M1 { id: ID firstName: String age: Int } union FooBar = M1 Example 5: following types Foo and Bar won't be merged into type M1 as they don't match exactly. Can't Merge type T1 and T2 as they've same field name but different type Can't Merge type T1 and T2 as they've same field name but different type # BEFORE type Foo { id: ID firstName: String age: Float } type Bar { id: ID firstName: String age: Int } union FooBar = Foo | Bar consolidateURL:​ The setting identifies the most common base URL among multiple REST endpoints and uses this URL in the upstream directive. It takes a threshold value between 0.0 and 1.0 to determine the most common endpoint. The default is 0.5. For example, if the Query type has three base URLs, using the consolidateURL setting with a 0.5 threshold will pick the base URL that is used in more than 50% of the http directives, http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, and add it to the upstream, cleaning the base URLs from the Query type. schema @server(hostname: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, port: 8000) @upstream(httpCache: 42) { query: Query } type Query { post(id: Int!): Post @http( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; path: &quot;/posts/{{.args.id}}&quot; ) posts: [Post] @http( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; path: &quot;/posts&quot; ) user(id: Int!): User @http( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; path: &quot;/users/{{.args.id}}&quot; ) users: [User] @http( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder-1.typicode.com&quot; path: &quot;/users&quot; ) } After enabling the consolidateURL setting: schema @server(hostname: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, port: 8000) @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; httpCache: 42 ) { query: Query } type Query { post(id: Int!): Post @http(path: &quot;/posts/{{.args.id}}&quot;) posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) user(id: Int!): User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.args.id}}&quot;) users: [User] @http( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder-1.typicode.com&quot; path: &quot;/users&quot; ) } unwrapSingleFieldTypes:​ This setting instructs Tailcall to flatten out types with single field. for example: type Query { foo: Foo } # Type with only one field type Foo { bar: Bar } # Type with only one field type Bar { a: Int } After setting unwrapSingleFieldTypes to true: type Query { foo: Int } This helps in flattening out types into single field.

Yet, the broader their scope, the more they diverge from being the perfect fit for any specific use case. This fundamental discrepancy — the impedance mismatch between the general capabilities of an API and the precise needs of a particular scenario — amplifies the necessity for an orchestration layer. Such a layer adeptly bridges this gap, tailor-fitting generic APIs to meet exact requirements with finesse. Tailcall stands at the forefront of this innovation, seamlessly transforming the way APIs are integrated and interacted with. Tailcall introduces a set of primitives, enabling developers to express and fine-tune how APIs are orchestrated without writing any code. This approach facilitates specifying different caching and batching strategies to enhance the overall system's efficiency. It also enables precise governance and access control mechanisms on actual domain entities and their relationships. Tailcall serves as a central hub for team collaboration, offering a unified point for managing all APIs, documentation, and more. Once configured, it positions itself between the clients and microservices, adeptly managing all requests and orchestrating them as needed. Manually crafting BFF (Backend for Frontend) layers has become outdated. With Tailcall, API orchestration evolves into a streamlined and highly optimized process. It functions as an essential intermediary, intelligently directing requests and assembling responses from each microservice. This approach diminishes the development burden associated with traditional BFF layers but also bolsters performance, reliability, and scalability throughout the application infrastructure.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Command Line Reference","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/tailcall-graphql-cli/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"check​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Command Line Reference","url":"/docs/tailcall-graphql-cli/#check","content":" The check command validates a composition spec.

It was originally developed to simplify endpoint management for REST-based APIs. Instead of maintaining multiple endpoints with small amounts of disjointed data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint that inputs complex queries and outputs only as much information as is needed for the query. This flexibility empowers developers to design more efficient and adaptable APIs, making GraphQL increasingly popular in modern web development.  At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching, where clients specify the exact structure of the data they require, and the server responds with precisely that data. This contrasts with REST APIs, where endpoints are predefined, and clients receive fixed responses regardless of their specific data needs.  To know more in detail about GraphQL, you can refer What is GraphQL.

Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively utilizing GraphQL in your projects.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"1. Schema​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#1-schema","content":" At the heart of every GraphQL API is the schema which is a set of types which completely describe the set of possible data you can query on that server. Then, when queries come in, they are validated and executed against that schema.  GraphQL schemas are typically defined using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), a simple syntax for describing types. Each type in the schema represents a distinct object in the API. Types can have fields that correspond to the properties of the object, as well as relationships to other types.  Here's a code snippet illustrating how a GraphQL schema might be defined using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL):  schema { query: Query } type Post { id: ID! title: String! content: String! userId: ID! } type Query { post(id: ID!): Post }   In this schema:  We define an object type: Post.Each Post object has fields for id, title, content, and a userId.We also define a root Query type, which contains entry points for querying individual users and posts by their IDs. We will dig deep into this in Next Section  This schema serves as a contract between the client and the server, defining the structure of the data available through the API and specifying how clients can interact with it. It forms the foundation for building and querying data in a GraphQL API. You can learn more about GraphQL Schema in detail.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"2. Query​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#2-query","content":" Most types in your schema will just be normal object types, but there are two types that are special within a schema Query and Mutation.  Every GraphQL server has a query type and may or may not have a mutation type. These types are the same as a regular object type, but they are special because they define the entry point of every GraphQL query. So if you see a query that looks like:  query { user(id: &quot;123&quot;) { name } }   That means that the GraphQL service needs to have a Query type with user field:  type Query { user(id: ID!): User }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"3. Mutation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#3-mutation","content":" Mutation work in a similar way as Query - you define fields on the Mutation type, and those are available as the root mutation fields you can call in your query.  It’s important to remember that other than the special status of being the “entry point” into the schema, the Query and Mutation types are the same as any other GraphQL object type, and their fields work exactly the same way. While queries are used for reading data from a GraphQL API, mutations are used for modifying or updating data. Mutations allow clients to perform actions such as creating, updating, or deleting objects in the API's data store.  Here's a code snippet illustrating how mutations might be defined in GraphQL:  type Mutation { createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): User! }   To query above mutation, you would use a query like this:  mutation { createUser( input: {name: &quot;Alice&quot;, email: &quot;dummy@gmail.com&quot;} ) { id name email } }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"4. Subscriptions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#4-subscriptions","content":" Subscriptions enable real-time communication between clients and servers in GraphQL APIs. Unlike queries and mutations, which are request-response interactions, subscriptions establish a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing the server to push updates to the client as they occur.  Subscriptions are defined in the GraphQL schema alongside queries and mutations, specifying the events or data changes that clients can subscribe to. Clients initiate a subscription by sending a subscription query to the server, which then notifies the client whenever the subscribed event occurs.  Here's a code snippet illustrating how subscriptions might be defined in GraphQL:  type Subscription { newMessage: Message! } type Message { id: ID! content: String! createdAt: String! } input SendMessageInput { content: String! } type Mutation { sendMessage(input: SendMessageInput!): Message! }   In this schema:  We define a Subscription type, which contains an entry point newMessage representing the event that clients can subscribe to receive updates about new messages.The newMessage subscription returns a Message object whenever a new message is created.We define a Message type with fields for id, content, and createdAt, representing a message object.We also define an input object type SendMessageInput with a field for content, which represents the input data for creating a new message.Finally, we have a Mutation type with an operation sendMessage that takes an input object of type SendMessageInput and returns the created Message object.  Clients can subscribe to the newMessage event to receive real-time updates whenever a new message is created. When a new message is created, the server pushes the updated message data to all subscribed clients in real-time.  In summary, the fundamental concepts of GraphQL—schema, queries, mutations, and subscriptions—provide a powerful framework for building flexible and efficient APIs that meet the diverse needs of modern applications.  This GraphQL configuration is enough for starting a GraphQL server using Tailcall. You can start the server using the start command.

Efficient Data Fetching​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#1-efficient-data-fetching","content":" One of the primary advantages of GraphQL is its ability to efficiently fetch data from the server. With GraphQL, clients can request only the specific fields they need, avoiding the problem of over-fetching data that often occurs with REST APIs. This minimizes the amount of data transferred over the network, leading to faster response times and improved performance for client applications.  Additionally, GraphQL enables clients to retrieve related pieces of data in a single request by specifying nested query structures. This eliminates the need for multiple round-trip requests to fetch data from different endpoints, further optimizing data fetching efficiency.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"2. Strongly-Typed Schema​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#2-strongly-typed-schema","content":" GraphQL employs a strongly-typed schema to define the structure of the API and the types of data it supports. This schema serves as a contract between the client and the server, providing clear documentation of the available data and operations.  By defining a schema upfront, GraphQL enables type checking and validation of queries at compile-time, catching errors early in the development process. This helps prevent runtime errors and improves the reliability of client-server interactions.  Additionally, the schema serves as a central source of truth for the API, making it easier for frontend and backend developers to collaborate. Changes to the schema can be communicated effectively, and tools can be built around the schema to provide features like autocomplete and code generation.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"3. Reduced Network Requests​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#3-reduced-network-requests","content":" GraphQL reduces the number of network requests required to fetch data by allowing clients to specify complex queries in a single request. Unlike REST APIs, which often require multiple requests to retrieve related data from different endpoints, GraphQL enables clients to fetch all the necessary data in a single round trip.  This reduction in network requests can have significant performance benefits, particularly for mobile and web applications operating over limited bandwidth or high-latency networks. By minimizing the overhead associated with network communication, GraphQL helps improve the responsiveness and efficiency of client applications.  In summary, GraphQL represents a paradigm shift in API design, offering developers greater flexibility, efficiency, and control over data fetching compared to traditional RESTful architectures. By leveraging the advantages of GraphQL—efficient data fetching, strongly-typed schema, and reduced network requests—developers can create more scalable, flexible, and performant systems that meet the needs of modern applications and users.

Defining a Schema​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#2-defining-a-schema","content":" The schema is a critical component of any GraphQL API, as it defines the types of data that clients can query and manipulate. GraphQL schemas are typically written using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), a simple syntax for describing types, fields, and relationships.  To define a schema, you'll need to specify the types of data available in your API, including objects, along with their associated fields and relationships. You'll also define query, mutation, and subscription types to specify the operations that clients can perform. for example:  schema { query: Query } type Post { id: ID! title: String! content: String! } type Query { post(id: ID!): Post }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"3. Attaching Resolvers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#3-attaching-resolvers","content":" Resolvers are responsible for fetching the data requested by clients and returning it in the appropriate format. Each field in your schema corresponds to a resolver function, which retrieves the data from your data sources, such as databases, APIs, or in-memory caches.  When a client sends a GraphQL query, the server resolves each field in the query by executing the corresponding resolver function. Resolvers may perform database queries, call external APIs, or perform other tasks to retrieve the requested data. Once the data is fetched, the resolvers return it to the client in the format specified by the GraphQL schema.  By setting up a GraphQL server, defining a schema, and attaching resolvers, you can begin building powerful and flexible APIs that provide clients with the precise data they need. This foundational knowledge forms the basis for more advanced GraphQL development, including integrating GraphQL with existing APIs, handling complex data relationships, and optimizing API performance.  Lets attach resolvers to the schema we defined in the previous section using Tailcall's GraphQL Configuration: We will add the resolvers with @http directive:  schema @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; ) { query: Query } type Post { id: ID! title: String! content: String! } type Query { post(id: ID!): Post @http(path: &quot;/posts/{{.args.id}}&quot;) }   In this example: We have used the @http directive to attach resolvers to the post field in the Query. and @upstream directive to define the base URL for the upstream server.  This configuration is enough for starting a GraphQL server using Tailcall. You can start the server using the start command.  For starting the server, you can use the following command:  tailcall start path/to/your-graphql-configuration   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"4. Handling Data Relationships​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL","url":"/graphql/#4-handling-data-relationships","content":" One of the strengths of GraphQL is its ability to handle data relationships with ease. When designing your GraphQL schema, consider how different types of data relate to each other and how clients may want to query or manipulate these relationships.  Use GraphQL's powerful type system to define clear relationships between your data types, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. This allows clients to fetch related data in a single query, reducing the need for multiple round-trip requests.  Here's a code snippet illustrating how to handle data relationships in GraphQL:  schema @upstream( baseURL: &quot;http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; ) { query: Query } type User { id: ID! name: String! email: String! } type Post { id: ID! title: String! content: String! userId: ID! author: User! @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.value.userId}}&quot;) } type Query { post(id: ID!): Post! @http(path: &quot;/posts/{{.args.id}}&quot;) }   In this example:  We define a User type representing a user object with fields for id, name, and email.We define a Post type representing a post object with fields for id, title, content, and userId.We establish a relationship between Post and User by adding an author field to the Post type.

To build a successful B2C business, you need to build for all three platforms viz. Android, iOS, and Web (Desktop/PWA). The applications need to look slick, rich in information, and have snappy response times.Microservice Proliferation: Many companies these days bootstrap themselves on microservices instead of monoliths.

An API gateway is a server that acts as a single point of entry for any type of request, responsible for routing requests to the appropriate backend service and forwarding the response to the client. An API gateway can also perform common tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching, making it a useful component in a microservices architecture: each service exposes an API to the gateway, and the gateway acts as the &quot;front desk&quot; for clients to access the services.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"API Orchestration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Problem Statement","url":"/graphql/problem-statement/#api-orchestration","content":" API orchestration refers to the process of combining one or more APIs to create a new API. This can be done by creating a new API that either acts as a facade for the underlying APIs, or splits up incoming requests, delegates to the underlying APIs, and combines the results back together. Consider a scenario where a social media client application wants to display a timeline of posts with the author's profile information next to each one. In this case, the client can send two separate requests to two different APIs and combine them as follows: First to /posts to retrieve recent posts, with the following response:  type Post { id: ID! title: String! body: String! userId: ID! # Reference to the user by its id. }   Second, with the userId from the above post response, make a request to /users to retrieve the user's profile information, with the following response:  type User { id: ID! name: String! email: String! }   The client can then combine the results from these two APIs to create a single response that contains all the required information. This new response can be considered as the output of the composed API.  type Post { id: ID! title: String! body: String! user: User # Reference to the complete user object }   Orchestration is not limited to stitching APIs, here are some other use cases where having an API Orchestrator is of significant value:  Access Control: Instead of building an “admin” API and a “customer” API, you could create a set of basic CRUD endpoints and build access control on top of the orchestrator. Localization: Adding support for language translations can be moved to an orchestration layer instead of embedding into the application layer. Batching: An orchestrator can intelligently leverage batch APIs automatically without the consumer making any change, thus drastically reducing load. Obfuscation: An orchestrator can precisely control which field needs to be obfuscated, how, and when. Protocol Translation: An orchestrator can very efficiently convert between protocols. Validations: An orchestrator could filter out invalid requests up front, reducing unnecessary work on the underlying services. Type Safe SDK: Orchestration engines can generate type safe client SDKs to consume APIs. Discoverability: Orchestrators can provide detailed &amp; up-to-date documentation of the APIs that are exposed. Collaboration: Allows consumers and producers of APIs to move at different speeds via &quot;mocking&quot;. Optimize APIs based on usage patterns. Breaking Changes: Identify breaking changes, performance degradations and other potential issues even before deployment. Business Logic: Logic controlling the flow of requests based on business conditions is best suited to execution within the gateway or orchestration layer. Distributed Management: Instead of giving control of all APIs to one team, each team can manage their part of the API and seamlessly compose with the existing API network.  important API Orchestration is distinct from Microservice Orchestration, the latter relates to managing multiple micro-services working together to perform a larger task or workflow.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Composition on Clients​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Problem Statement","url":"/graphql/problem-statement/#composition-on-clients","content":" Composition on the client side remains unstandardized. Common problems include over-fetching and under-fetching. Over-fetching is where the server responds to a client request with more data than is required to render the screen. Under fetching is where the client needs to make multiple, often chained, API requests to get relevant data for a particular screen because the server couldn't provide all the required data in a single request. These two problems in conjunction with modest hardware and an unreliable network connection can make the overall solution unreliable, slow, and frustrating.  tip When composing on the client side, modest hardware and unfavorable network conditions often result in poor user-experience.  Increased Complexity:To build a rich user interface, API composition is necessary. One of the main challenges with API composition on the client side is that it can lead to increased complexity in the client application: the client needs to handle sending requests to multiple APIs and combining the results, adding to the overall size and complexity of the client code. Reduced Performance:Another challenge with API composition on the client side is that it can result in reduced performance and increased latency:the client often needs to make multiple requests to different APIs, taking more time and resulting in a slower response from the composed API. Increased Risk:In addition, API composition on the client side can also lead to increased security risks:the client needs to handle sensitive information such as API keys and authentication credentials for multiple APIs. These critical security tokens can be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured, and many clients lack access to powerful CPUs and reliable network connections.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Backend For Frontend (BFF)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Problem Statement","url":"/graphql/problem-statement/#backend-for-frontend-bff","content":" A BFF layer can help to solve the challenges of API composition mentioned above by providing a separate backend service that is optimized for each specific frontend client. This can enable the BFF to perform API composition on behalf of the client, which can help to improve the performance and reliability of the composed API. The BFF layer typically sits as a separate component in the overall architecture, between the frontend client and the microservices. It can communicate with both the frontend client and the microservices using well-defined interfaces and protocols, such as REST or gRPC.  tip BFFs can dramatically improve the reliability and performance of the system, thereby having a direct positive impact on user-experience.  The BFF can take advantage of a powerful CPU and access to a fast network to improve the performance and reliability of the composed API. It can also provide added flexibility and control over the composition process. This can make it a useful tool for developers who want to create new APIs by combining the functionality of multiple underlying APIs. However, there are a few challenges with a BFF layer:  Highly Specialized:BFF layers are highly specialized solutions that require a significant amount of hand-written code. Unlike an API gateway, there is no standard BFF solution that can be deployed out-of-the-box, and each BFF implementation must be custom-tailored to the specific requirements of the frontend client. This lack of standardization and reusability can make the BFF solution more complex and difficult to maintain. Fragile:Fragile and susceptible to failure, the BFF solution is dependent on the developers to follow best practices and handle all error scenarios. If these steps are not taken, the solution can be prone to bugs and performance issues. Additionally, the BFF solution must be thoroughly tested, including performance testing, unit testing, and integration testing, to ensure that it is reliable and performs well in production. This can require significant effort and expertise, and if these steps are not properly followed, the resulting BFF solution will likely be fragile and prone to failure. Since the BFF layer is the client's sole entry point to your backend, it becoming unavailable translates into a complete service outage for the user - it is therefore essential this layer be robust and resilient to exceptions. Speculative Performance:Because BFF layers are typically custom-written for each use case, it can be difficult to predict the performance impact of a small code change. Issues such as unoptimized algorithms, inefficient caching, and unnecessary downstream requests can go unnoticed and only be discovered very late in the development cycle. Typically this means companies must perform thorough benchmarking and load testing before anything goes to production, resulting in a high time to market even for minor changes. Monolithic:This layer frequently becomes quite comprehensive, intertwining with numerous backend services. It's not unusual for it to include a significant amount of complex, manually written code that can be challenging to manage. These issues can make it more difficult for new engineers to get up to speed, and can increase the time and cost associated with updating libraries or making architectural enhancements. Even small changes might necessitate large scale deployments across your infrastructure. Canary Support (Lack thereof):Every change that happens in the backend requires the deployment of the BFF layer. Any feature that is built on the client also requires changes on the BFF layer. Such frequent changes can not be exposed to 100% of users because the reliability and performance of this system are unknown. A common way to solve this problem is to use Blue-Green deployments. This requires additional infrastructure and complex routing mechanisms. First-class support to do canary releases is very important and should be part of a modern BFF layer, however, most companies rely on DevOps for its support. Coupled Releases:Since the BFF layer acts as a bridge between clients and services it serves as the middle link in the dependency chain: the client depends on the BFF, which in turn depends on the services. When it's time to deploy new features, first you must deploy the new services (which must support the existing and new BFF), then the new BFF layer is deployed (which must support existing and new clients), and finally the client can be deployed. If, due to a bug in a microservice, you need to revert the services, then you'd also need to replace the BFF layer with one that supports the new client calls even though the services have (temporarily) lost support for these calls. This coupling makes for expensive operational management. Composability:Traditional APIs, such as REST, work well when interacting directly with a single data source. REST benefits from a mature infrastructure that handles various cross-cutting concerns, such as routing, load balancing, caching, rate limiting, authentication, and authorization. However, the semantics of these capabilities start to break down when we consider API composition. For example, imagine an API composed of two other APIs, where one is highly cacheable and the other is not well defined. The same issues arise with authorization, authentication, and rate limiting. This inherent lack of composability makes REST challenging to use in scenarios requiring API composition.  note Presentation Layer, Facade, Middleware, Frontend Layer, Orchestration Layer, API Adapter — these are all terms that are sometimes used to refer to the BFF layer ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Is GraphQL Better Than REST?

It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Each resource in a RESTful system is identified by a unique URI and can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. It is designed to utilize the stateless operations of the HTTP protocol for web communications. REST has been widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness in designing scalable web services. Detailed Example: Consider a typical social media platform:  GET /users // Retrieves a list of users POST /users // Creates a new user GET /users/123 // Retrieves details about user 123 GET /users/123/posts // Retrieves posts by user 123 GET /users/123/followers // Retrieves followers of user 123 GET /posts // Retrieves posts POST /posts // Creates a post GET /posts/123/comments // Retrieves comments for post 123   REST API Design  Each endpoint is designed to handle a specific type of resource and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Server also defines when to invalidate the cached response for a particular request to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data. A good caching practice can significantly reduce the number of requests to the server.Layered System: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary along the way. A REST API can consist of multiple layers of servers, each with its own specific functionality. For example, an E-Commerce application might have a server for authentication, another for product information, and a third for payment processing.

It modifies the schema and the data transformation process, making nested data more accessible and straightforward to present.  For instance, consider a schema:  schema { query: Query } type User @addField(name: &quot;street&quot;, path: [&quot;address&quot;, &quot;street&quot;]) { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! phone: String website: String address: Address @modify(omit: true) } type Address { street: String! city: String! state: String! } type Query { user(id: Int!): User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.args.id}}&quot;) }   Suppose we focus on the street field in Address.  In this case, applying the @addField directive to the User type creates a street field within the User type. It uses a path argument to specify the sequence of fields from a declared field (address), leading to the Address field to add. We also can apply @modify(omit: true) to remove the address field from the schema, as the street field from Address is now directly accessible on the User type.  Post application, the schema becomes:  schema { query: Query } type User { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! phone: String website: String street: String } type Query { user(id: Int): Post! }   In the above example, since we added a @modify(omit: true) on the address field, the schema no longer includes the Address type.  The @addField directive also take cares of nullablity of the fields. If any of the fields in the path is nullable, the resulting type will be nullable.  @addField also supports indexing, allowing for the specification of an array index for inline inclusion. For instance, if a field posts is of type [Post], and the goal is to access the title of the first post, specify the path as [&quot;posts&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;].  type User @addField( name: &quot;firstPostTitle&quot; path: [&quot;posts&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;title&quot;] ) { id: Int! name: String! username: String! email: String! phone: String website: String posts: Post @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.value.id}}/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: Int! userId: Int! title: String! body: String! }   In conclusion, the @addField directive helps tidy up your schema and streamline data fetching by reducing query depth, promoting better performance and simplicity.

But it does not cache the values of userId and title because they lack individual resolvers; the resolver for the posts field retrieves their values, employing the @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) directive.  Applying the @cache directive at the type level affects all fields within that type. For example:  type Query { posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post @cache(maxAge: 100) { id: Int title: String userId: Int user: User @http(path: &quot;/user/{{.value.userId}}&quot;) } type User { id: Int name: String email: String }   You can simplify this configuration to show that applying the @cache directive to a type means every field within that type inherits it:  type Query { posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: Int @cache(maxAge: 100) title: String @cache(maxAge: 100) userId: Int @cache(maxAge: 100) user: User @http(path: &quot;/user/{{.value.userId}}&quot;) @cache(maxAge: 100) } type User { id: Int name: String email: String }   Since the @cache directive does not affect fields without resolvers, the effective configuration can be further reduced as follows:  type Query { posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: Int title: String userId: Int user: User @http(path: &quot;/user/{{.value.userId}}&quot;) @cache(maxAge: 100) } type User { id: Int name: String email: String }   When applying the @cache directive both at the type level and on individual fields within that type, the field-level directive takes precedence:  type Query { posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post @cache(maxAge: 200) { id: Int title: String userId: Int user: User @http(path: &quot;/user/{{.value.userId}}&quot;) @cache(maxAge: 100) } type User { id: Int name: String email: String }   Thus, in the configuration above, while all fields inherit the @cache(maxAge: 200) directive at the type level, the user field's explicit @cache(maxAge: 100) directive takes precedence.

This directive is pivotal for developers navigating the intricacies of elaborate GraphQL schemas, where minimizing redundancy and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle are paramount. Consider the following schema example:  schema @upstream( baseURL: &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&quot; ) { query: Query } type Query { user(id: Int!): User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.args.id}}&quot;) posts: [Post] @http(path: &quot;/posts&quot;) } type Post { id: Int! userId: Int! title: String! body: String! user: User @http(path: &quot;/users/{{.value.userId}}&quot;) } type User { id: Int! name: String! email: String! }   In this schema, at lines 9 and 18, a pattern of configuration duplication emerges when fetching user's data by its id, demonstrating a prime use case for the @call directive. Through refactoring the Post type to incorporate the @call directive, we can eliminate this redundancy.  type Post { id: Int! userId: Int! title: String! body: String! user: User @call( steps: [ {query: &quot;user&quot;, args: {id: &quot;{{.value.userId}}&quot;}} ] ) }   Here, the @call directive invokes the user query from the Query type, leveraging the data-fetching process that's already defined in the root query.

These steps are executed such that the result of each step is passed as an argument to the next step. The query and mutation parameters are used to specify the target field, while the args parameter is used to pass arguments to the target field.  Let's explain this with an example:  schema @server { query: Query } type Query { a(input: JSON): JSON @expr(body: {value: &quot;{{.args.input.a}}&quot;}) b(input: JSON): JSON @expr(body: {value: &quot;{{.args.input.b}}&quot;}) c(input: JSON): JSON @expr(body: {value: &quot;{{.args.input.c}}&quot;}) }   Here we have defined there operations viz. a, b &amp; c each of them pluck their respective keys from the given input value. Let's run this query with some test input:  { a(input: {a: 100}) b(input: {b: 200}) c(input: {c: 300}) }   Here is how the response would look like:  { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;a&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: 100 }, &quot;b&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: 200 }, &quot;c&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: 300 } } }   As you can see the @expr directive plucks the inner value and returns the result. How about we implement an abc operation that could leverage the existing operations and unwrap the following input value:  {&quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: {&quot;c&quot;: {&quot;d&quot;: 1000}}}}   Given the above input if we wish to extract the last inner number 1000 then we could define a new operation as follows  schema @server { query: Query } type Query { a(input: JSON): JSON @expr(body: {value: &quot;{{.args.input.a}}&quot;}) b(input: JSON): JSON @expr(body: {value: &quot;{{.args.input.b}}&quot;}) c(input: JSON): JSON @expr(body: {value: &quot;{{.args.input.c}}&quot;}) abc(input: JSON): JSON @call( steps: [ {query: &quot;a&quot;, args: {input: &quot;{{.args.input}}&quot;}} {query: &quot;b&quot;, args: {input: &quot;{{.args.value}}&quot;}} {query: &quot;c&quot;, args: {input: &quot;{{.args.value}}&quot;}} ] ) }   We use the @call directive to compose the operations together. The args specify how we would like to pass the arguments to the operation and the result of that operation is passed to the next step. We can test the new abc operation with the following query:  query { abc(input: {a: {b: {c: 1000}}}) }   The server returns the response that we expected:  { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;abc&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: 100 } } }   This way you can compose combine multiple operations can compose them together using the @call directive.  note We use JSON scalar here because we don't care about the type safety of this option.
