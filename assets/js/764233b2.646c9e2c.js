From the perspective of a platform engineer, the goal is to develop APIs that cater to a broad range of needs. Yet, crafting a unique API for every conceivable requirement is neither practical nor efficient. Consequently, engineers often end up creating generalized APIs. However, as a consumer, you might find these APIs lacking in some respects while being superfluous in others. Furthermore, as your needs evolve, so does your notion of the ideal API, exacerbating this mismatch.
