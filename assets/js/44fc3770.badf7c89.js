Hopefully, this guide underscores the effectiveness of Tailcall in addressing the N+1 problem."]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(s.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(s.img,{alt:"Requests made after optimizations",src:n(25405).A+"",width:"2001",height:"1006"})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:s}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return s?(0,t.jsx)(s,{...e,children:(0,t.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},25405:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{A:()=>t});const t=n.p+"assets/images/n+1-after-8ef8cee93de6ec00ebed0d704bea0224.png"},16131:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{A:()=>t});const t=n.p+"assets/images/n+1-batch-227057b25e7cf2688d4985b056179e6c.png"},31050:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{A:()=>t});const t=n.p+"assets/images/n+1-before-ab9c95208f6e2c3933721b456bc9245a.png"},59768:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{A:()=>t});const t=n.p+"assets/images/n+1-duplicate-d7ebe2ce6262463ba6e5b8d8077c8efd.png"},47010:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{A:()=>t});const t=n.p+"assets/images/n+1-issue-81f278d76d32c29bfeafbe72ea913ef9.png"},23814:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{A:()=>t});const t=n.p+"assets/images/n+1-unique-2a6b2c32101fd1472eac5eac44a62890.png"},28453:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{R:()=>a,x:()=>l});var t=n(96540);const i={},r=t.createContext(i);function a(e){const s=t.useContext(r);return t.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(s):{...s,...e}}),[s,e])}function l(e){let s;return s=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:a(e.components),t.createElement(r.Provider,{value:s},e.children)}}}]);
