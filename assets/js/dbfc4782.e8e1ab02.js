That was the exciting challenge we faced at [Dream11, India\'s largest fantasy sports platform](https://www.dream11.com/).\\n\\nAs a former employees, We\'re thrilled to share how we harnessed the power of GraphQL to create a platform that\'s not just scalable and performant, but also a joy for both users and developers to interact with.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Case Study: Dream11\'s GraphQL Journey\\n\\n### The Challenge: Taming the Monolith\\n\\nDuring our time at Dream11, we embarked on several major re-architecture projects to supercharge our systems\' performance and scalability. But perhaps the most exhilarating (and occasionally hair-raising) journey was our transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices.\\n\\nNow, let us tell you, this wasn\'t a walk in the park. We faced hurdles at every turn. But we had one golden rule that guided us through the chaos: \\"The frontend should never be shackled by the backend\'s structure.\\" This mantra led us to an exciting solution: using GraphQL as a backend-for-frontend (BFF).\\n\\n## The Magic of Backend-for-Frontends (BFFs)\\n\\nThink of BFFs as the ultimate middlemen, sitting between our microservices and frontend applications. They\'re not just passing messages; they\'re tailoring responses and error handling for each client application. It\'s like having a personal assistant for each of your frontend apps! By implementing BFFs, we unlocked a treasure trove of advantages:\\n\\n- **No more data bloat:** Say goodbye to under-fetching and over-fetching. Our BFFs serve each client exactly what they need, nothing more, nothing less.\\n- **Divide and conquer:** With BFFs handling the heavy lifting of data formatting, our frontend developers could focus on crafting amazing user experiences.\\n- **Network efficiency:** Imagine making one call instead of ten. That\'s the power of BFFs \u2013 they fetch data from multiple sources in one go, keeping our network traffic lean and mean.\\n\\n## Dream11\'s Microservices Odyssey\\n\\nNow, we could have gone for the \\"big bang\\" approach, but where\'s the fun (or safety) in that? Instead, we opted for a more measured journey:\\n\\n1. First, we moved all our monolith APIs to a GraphQL-based BFF.\\n2. We then directed all frontend applications to this new BFF, even adding a lint check to catch any sneaky direct API calls to the monolith.\\n3. Once we were confident in our new setup, we began the exciting process of moving APIs to microservices, one by one.\\n\\nSure, it was a longer path, but it was smoother sailing. We minimized risks, kept our testing manageable, and, most importantly, kept our sanity intact!\\n\\n![Micro service journey](../static/images/blog/monolith-to-microservices.png)\\n\\n## Unveiling Dream11\'s BFF Architecture\\n\\nLet me pull back the curtain on our BFF architecture at Dream11. It was a symphony of components working in perfect harmony:\\n\\n- **Frontend Applications:** The face of our platform, built in React. They took the data from our GraphQL server and transformed it into the engaging user interfaces our players loved.\\n- **GraphQL Server:** The maestro of our operation, built with Apollo Server. It orchestrated data fetching from microservices and delivered it beautifully to our frontend applications.\\n- **API Gateway:** The bouncer of our architecture, powered by Kong. It managed the flow of requests from the GraphQL server to our microservices.\\n- **Microservices:** Our data virtuosos, crafted with Node.js and Express. They fetched data from databases and passed it to the GraphQL server.\\n\\n![Architecture diagram explaining Dream11 GraphQL Based BFF Architecture](../static/images/blog/dream11_bff.png)\\n\\nNow, you might be scratching your head, wondering, \\"Why put an API Gateway after the GraphQL server?\\" Great question! It all comes down to resilience. We needed fine-grained control over rate limiting and circuit breaking for each microservice. GraphQL\'s single endpoint made this tricky, so we added this extra layer to keep our systems robust and responsive.\\n\\nThis architecture was our trusted companion for years, scaling effortlessly to serve tens of millions of users. But as with any great journey, we eventually hit a new challenge: the performance of our GraphQL server started to feel the strain of our massive success.\\n\\n<div style={{ position: \'relative\', paddingBottom: \'56.25%\', height: 0, overflow: \'hidden\', maxWidth:\'100%\'}}>\\n  <iframe\\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Esb7oQ0PuXw?si=kuSvBFaUki2GYJie&rel=0\\"\\n    frameBorder=\\"0\\"\\n    title=\\"Lessons for Scaling GraphQL\\"\\n    style={{ position: \'absolute\', top: 0, left: 0, width: \'100%\', height: \'100%\', border: 0 }}\\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\"\\n    referrerPolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\"\\n    allowFullScreen\\n  ></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## The GraphQL Advantage: Dream11\'s Secret Weapon\\n\\nImplementing GraphQL for our BFF layer wasn\'t just a technical decision \u2013 it was a game-changer. Here\'s why we fell in love with GraphQL:\\n\\n- **Network efficiency on steroids:** We slashed unnecessary network calls, making our app lightning-fast.\\n- **Bug squashing made easy:** Type-safe queries generated at compile time meant fewer surprises in production.\\n- **Performance boost:** We fetched only the data we needed, nothing more, nothing less. Also reduced multiple round trips to the server.\\n- **Flexibility unleashed:** We could structure our data exactly how we wanted, adapting to new requirements with ease.\\n- **Cross-platform harmony:** Consistency across all platforms became a breeze.\\n- **Developer joy:** Our frontend team couldn\'t stop raving about how easy it was to work with.\\n- **Time is money:** Reduced development time meant we could innovate faster.\\n- **Happy developers, happy life:** The improved developer experience led to more creative solutions and happier teams.\\n\\n## The Next Chapter: From Challenges to Solutions\\n\\nThe journey we embarked on at Dream11 wasn\'t just about solving immediate problems \u2013 it was about reimagining how we approach backend architecture for massive-scale applications. The challenges we faced, the solutions we crafted, and the lessons we learned have directly shaped the development of Tailcall.\\n\\nTailcall emerged from the crucible of these experiences, designed to make the implementation of GraphQL and similar migration journeys significantly easier for other companies.

While the latter helps businesses decompose their applications into small independent services, the former makes it possible for the clients of these services to request only data of interest. Each of these technologies address specific challenges inherent in building modern applications, and when combined, they offer a powerful toolkit for developers aiming to create efficient and robust APIs.\\n\\nBut is it really worth combining the two or is it just a new shiny object with all the hype? Is it really cost-efficient and time-saving or just an expensive thing for tech majors? Read on as I explore the challenges, features and considerations of using GraphQL with microservices. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## What Are Microservices?\\n\\n![independent scaling](/images/graphql/scaling.png)\\n\\nCompared to traditional monolithic architecture, in which all the constituents of an application are usually closely integrated and interwoven, **microservices** present a very compelling option. Microservices really orient the technique of decomposition and isolation. Development, scaling, and deployment for every service can be independent. It provides high flexibility and a better developer experience.\\n\\nThe three key characteristics of microservices are **scalability**, **flexibility**, and **maintainability**. The components of the system can be scaled as needed, and in terms of priority. Different languages and technologies can also be used to realize each service according to use cases appropriate for individual use, which can be developed and maintained independently by different teams. Cleanup will not only be in the debugging phase; it will also accelerate the development cycle, from which you can easily adapt and evolve your application over time.\\n\\n![spotify logo](/images/graphql/spotify.png)\\n\\n### Example: Spotify\\n\\n**Spotify** is a prime example of [successful microservice adoption](https://medium.com/codebase/microservices-architecture-at-spotify-beac905e9622). To efficiently support millions of monthly users, Spotify restructured its application into microservices, resulting in impressive performance and scalability. These microservices likely handle various specialized tasks, such as:\\n\\n- Recommending tracks based on a user\u2019s listening history.\\n- Identifying the genre and theme of each track.\\n- Personalizing playlists for users by combining insights from the recommendation and genre microservices.\\n- Delivering lyrics for tracks.\\n\\n[Read: Migrating To Microservices](https://tailcall.run/blog/graphql-microservices-migration/).\\n\\n## What is GraphQL?\\n\\n**[GraphQL](https://tailcall.run/graphql/)** was designed based on the concept of _returning precisely what is asked for; no more, no less_. Open-sourced by Facebook in 2015, it fixes ancient issues of over-fetching and under-fetching that plagued REST APIs right from their very invention.\\n\\nIt empowers the client with **flexibility** regarding which particular fields to request in any use case. This is possible due to the **strongly typed schema** that clearly defines the data structure of the API and specifies what it returns. Plus, subscriptions allow GraphQL to return **real-time data**, meeting demands of modern applications.\\n\\n### Example: GitHub\\n\\n**GitHub** is one of the [prominent adopters of GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/about-the-graphql-api). By implementing GraphQL, GitHub provides its users with a more flexible and efficient way to interact with its API. Developers can query for specific data, such as repositories, issues, and commits, all within a single request, enhancing the efficiency of their applications.\\n\\n## Combining GraphQL and Microservices\\n\\nThe true magic happens when **GraphQL** and **microservices** are combined. This pairing allows developers to harness the power of microservices while mitigating some of the complexities associated with them.\\n\\n### Benefits of Combining GraphQL and Microservices\\n\\nBy design, GraphQL has made optimization of **data retrieval** and parallel resolutions intrinsic to the system. **Error management** is also much smoother because of the automatic process of partial resolutions and formation of response as a whole. Further, due to **flexibility** and clear ownership, GraphQL makes it possible for clients to fetch data from different microservices. This grants extra control to the clients while communicating with microservices.\\n\\n_fetching data from multiple microservices using Tailcall:_\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  tracks: TrackData!\\n    @grpc(method: \\"tracks.trackService.listTracks\\")\\n}\\n\\ntype Track {\\n  id: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  audioUrl: String!\\n  reactions: [Reaction]\\n    @http(path: \\"/tracks/{{.value.id}}/reactions\\")\\n  lyrics: [Lyric]\\n    @grpc(\\n      body: \\"{{.value.id}}\\"\\n      method: \\"tracks.trackService.getLyrics\\"\\n    )\\n}\\n\\ntype TrackData {\\n  track: [Track]!\\n}\\n\\ntype Reaction {\\n  emoji: String!\\n  count: Int!\\n}\\n\\ntype Lyric {\\n  text: String!\\n  timestampSecond: Int!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Challenges of Combining GraphQL and Microservices\\n\\nSometimes, it\'s a pathway to **overengineering** for an application. You could end up writing long, sprawling schemas and queries for things you could have implemented in a few lines of code in REST. It can bring in unnecessary **complexity** and make it harder for another developer to implement something else in the app.\\n\\n![n + 1 problem](../static/images/graphql/n+1-issue.png)\\n\\nAnother well-known challenge is the **N+1 problem**: this happens when a GraphQL query requesting nested data provokes plural sequential calls to a microservice, often due to a poorly designed schema. Fortunately, Tailcall has a solution to this problem built into the box, thus making your development easier and more efficient. [Read How](https://tailcall.run/docs/graphql-n-plus-one-problem-solved-tailcall/#n1-in-graphql-using-tailcall).\\n\\n### Example: Netflix\\n\\n**Netflix** is a prime example of a company that [successfully implemented microservices](https://netflixtechblog.com/rebuilding-netflix-video-processing-pipeline-with-microservices-4e5e6310e359), transforming its monolithic application into a more scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient system. By adopting this architecture, Netflix enables each service, such as user profiles, content delivery, and recommendations, to operate independently while seamlessly integrating to provide a cohesive user experience. This approach allows Netflix to scale services based on demand, with resource-intensive microservices like content recommendations being scaled more aggressively than less demanding ones, such as age-group rating calculations.\\n\\n## Designing Scalable APIs with GraphQL and Microservices\\n\\nDesigning scalable APIs that leverage both **GraphQL** and **microservices** requires careful planning and adherence to certain principles.\\n\\n1. **Schema Design:** Begin with a robust, well-defined schema that accurately represents your data and services. A modular schema is crucial, as it allows your application to grow and evolve without causing disruptions. Ensure that the schema is flexible enough to accommodate new features and changes as your application scales.\\n2. **Service Orchestration:** To manage the complexity of multiple microservices, implement a service orchestration layer that coordinates communication between the GraphQL server and underlying services. This layer should handle essential tasks such as load balancing, caching, and fallback mechanisms to ensure seamless interactions and maintain API performance under varying loads.\\n3. **Caching:** Utilize effective caching strategies at both the GraphQL and microservice levels to enhance performance. Caching reduces the need for repeated data retrieval, lowering latency and improving the user experience. Consider using in-memory caches for frequently accessed data and implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.\\n4. **Monitoring and Logging:** Comprehensive monitoring and logging are vital for tracking API performance, identifying potential bottlenecks, and quickly resolving issues. Implementing detailed logging with tools like OpenTelemetry provides valuable insights into the behavior of your API, helping you maintain high availability and optimize performance over time.\\n\\n5. **Security:** With **Tailcall\'s** [built-in auth](https://tailcall.run/docs/field-level-access-control-graphql-authentication/) and [@protected](https://tailcall.run/docs/tailcall-dsl-graphql-custom-directives/#protected-directive) directive, you can add auth functionality and make fields protected with just a few lines of code - which is intelligent enough to protect any query that indirectly resolves to that field:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Reaction @protected {\\n  emoji: String!\\n  count: Int!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n6. **Strong Typing:** Nothing can be more painful than having to work with a poorly-typed GraphQL schema where you had `email` and `url` as `string`, but with handmade validation code. These omissions are a big mistake which could usher in potential errors and inconsistencies in handling your data. Instead, make full use of GraphQL\'s in-built scalars and custom types. It leverages these built-in scalars to ensure that fields are valid according to the expected data types, reducing the need for error-prone manual validation:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  findMyAccount(phone: PhoneNumber!): Account!\\n    @http(path: \\"/accounts?phone={{.args.phone}}\\")\\n}\\ntype Account {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n[Read: Designing The Perfect GraphQL Schema](https://tailcall.run/blog/graphql-schema/)\\n\\n### Example: Airbnb\\n\\nAirbnb successfully implemented scalable APIs [by combining GraphQL and microservices](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/12/airbnb-graphql-migration/). Airbnb\u2019s GraphQL layer acts as an abstraction over numerous microservices, allowing clients to retrieve data efficiently and consistently. By following the principles of schema design, service orchestration, and caching, Airbnb has built a robust platform that can scale with demand.\\n\\n### Where Tailcall Comes In\\n\\nWhen implementing a combination of GraphQL and microservices, the integration process can become complex, particularly when dealing with schema management, service orchestration, and security concerns. [Tools like Tailcall](https://tailcall.run/graphql/) can significantly simplify this process by providing a seamless integration layer that handles the intricacies of connecting GraphQL with various microservices. Tailcall enables developers to focus on building business logic rather than managing the underlying infrastructure, accelerating development and reducing potential errors.\\n\\n<CallToAction\\ntitle=\\"Ready to build your next app with GraphQL?\\"\\nsubtitle= \\"Don\u2019t get left behind - Try Tailcall today\\"\\nbuttonText=\\"Get Started\\"\\nbackgroundImageSrc=\\"/icons/basic/bg-tailcall.svg\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Security and Authentication with GraphQL and Microservices\\n\\nSecurity is a major concern when integrating **GraphQL** with **microservices**. Without proper safeguards, the powerful flexibility of GraphQL can lead to significant risks.\\n\\n### Major Concerns about Security:\\n\\n1. **Query Complexity**: The superpower of GraphQL is letting clients create incredibly intricate and deeply nested queries. Sometimes, however, this becomes a nemesis. Imagine this: a bad user sending a query that is as deep as a rabbit hole, asking for endless amounts of data and gasping your server\'s breath. To keep things at hand and prevent your server from melting down, some ground rules should be created. Design query complexity analysis and set **depth limits** to make sure that queries are of manageable size; otherwise, they can overload your server. Have A Look:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  songs {\\n    # Fetch all songs\\n    author {\\n      # For each song, fetch the author\'s details\\n      songs {\\n        # For each author, fetch their songs\\n        author {\\n          # For each song by the author, fetch the author\'s details again\\n          comments # Retrieve the comments for each author\\n        } # and this can go forever - until your server overloads\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. **Authentication and Authorization**: If you need to protect your microservices, some strong security configuration is requisite. Every microservice should be armed with a guard at the level of authentication and authorization. But don\'t stop here. Scale up these security measures to the GraphQL layer. Next, it will help you set up solid authentication strategies and fine-grained access controls right in your GraphQL schema. Think of this as having a bouncer at your door to make sure only the proper users get access to the proper data.\\n\\n3. **Exposure of Data**: GraphQL\'s introspection and flexible queries can sometimes be a two-edged sword. Unless properly controlled, sensitive information may slip out and unintentionally be exposed. Implement strict field-level access control that guides how data can be queried and by whom to keep your data safe and sound. [Read: How is Introspection a Hidden Treasure for Attackers](https://tailcall.run/blog/graphql-introspection-security/#the-security-implications-of-introspection)\\n\\n### Example: Facebook\\n\\n**Facebook**, the creator of GraphQL, [has implemented robust security measures to protect its API](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/05/08/web/facebook-redesign/). Query complexity analysis, rate limiting, and other strict authentication protocols are all part of Facebook\'s efforts to secure the platform.

Always conduct thorough research and planning before diving into GraphQL. To make the process easier and more secure, consider [using tools like Tailcall](https://tailcall.run/docs/) to streamline integration and fully unlock your API\'s potential.

The monolithic architecture, which once served organizations well, is increasingly becoming a bottleneck as applications grow in complexity and scale. Many organizations are shifting towards microservices to address these challenges, but migration is often fraught with complexity, particularly in areas like data management, service communication, and deployment.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nGraphQL, a query language for your API, offers a flexible and efficient way to interact with data, making it an ideal tool for easing the transition. This article will explore the intricacies of migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices, the challenges involved, and how GraphQL can simplify the migration process.\\n\\n## Understanding Monoliths and Microservices\\n\\n### What is a Monolithic Architecture?\\n\\nA monolithic architecture is a traditional software development model where all components of an application are tightly coupled together and run as a single service. This architecture is characterized by:\\n\\n1. **Single Codebase:** The entire application\u2019s functionality is contained within one codebase.\\n2. **Tightly Coupled Components:** All modules are interdependent, meaning a change in one module can affect the entire system.\\n3. **Single Deployment Unit:** The entire application is deployed as a single unit, making scaling a challenge.\\n\\nMonolithic architectures are straightforward to develop initially but become increasingly difficult to manage as the application grows. Changes to one part of the system require rebuilding and redeploying the entire application, leading to slower development cycles and potential downtime.\\n\\n### What are Microservices?\\n\\nMicroservices are a design pattern where an application is divided into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Key characteristics of microservices include:\\n\\n1. **Independently Deployable Services:** Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\\n2. **Decoupled Components:** Services are loosely coupled, meaning changes in one service typically do not impact others.\\n3. **Domain-Driven Design:** Each microservice is aligned with a specific business function or domain.\\n\\nMicroservice architecture addresses many of the scalability and maintainability challenges of monolithic systems. However, it can introduce complexity in initial development.\\n\\n### Why Migrate from Monolith to Microservices?\\n\\nMigrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices offers several advantages:\\n\\n1. **Scalability:** Microservices allow you to scale individual components independently based on demand.\\n2. **Agility:** Independent services enable faster development cycles and easier maintenance.\\n3. **Resilience:** Failures in one service do not necessarily bring down the entire application.\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the migration process is complex and requires careful planning and execution.\\n\\n## Challenges in Monolith to Microservices Migration\\n\\nMigrating to microservices presents several challenges that organizations must address to ensure a successful transition.\\n\\n### Data Management and Consistency\\n\\nIn a monolithic system, data is typically stored in a single database, making it easier to maintain consistency. In a microservice architecture, each service often has its database, leading to challenges in maintaining data consistency across services. Data integrity and managing distributed transactions are significant hurdles in the migration process.\\n\\n### Service Communication\\n\\nMonolithic applications typically rely on in-process communication, which is efficient and straightforward. In a microservice architecture, services must communicate over a network, introducing latency and potential failures. Managing inter-service communication, especially in distributed environments, requires robust strategies such as service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breakers.\\n\\n### Deployment Complexity\\n\\nDeploying a monolithic application is relatively simple, as there is only one deployment unit. However, in a microservice architecture, each service must be deployed independently, often with different versions running simultaneously. Managing these deployments, along with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, adds significant complexity.\\n\\n## Introduction to GraphQL\\n\\n### What is GraphQL?\\n\\nGraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that was developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015. Unlike REST, which exposes multiple endpoints for different types of data, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need through a single endpoint. This flexibility makes GraphQL an excellent choice for applications with complex data needs.\\n[Read More...](/graphql/what-is-graphql/)\\n\\n### Key Features of GraphQL\\n\\n- **Declarative Data Fetching:** Clients specify the shape and structure of the data they need, which only fetches the required data.\\n- **Single Endpoint:** All data queries are sent to a single endpoint, simplifying API design and usage.\\n- **Strong Typing:** GraphQL schemas are strongly typed, providing clear documentation and reducing errors.\\n- **API Contract** GraphQL schema acts as a contract between the client and server, ensuring a clear understanding of data requirements.\\n\\n### GraphQL vs REST\\n\\nWhile REST is based on a fixed set of endpoints that return specific data, GraphQL offers a Contract-First approach, which is crucial for decoupling the client and server. Which is very important so that your splitting of the monolith into microservices can be done without affecting the client.\\n\\nTo learn more about the differences between GraphQL and REST, read our article on [GraphQL vs REST](/graphql/graphql-vs-rest-api-comparison/).\\n\\n## How GraphQL Simplifies Microservices Migration\\n\\n### Unified Data Access Layer\\n\\nGraphQL provides a unified data access layer that abstracts the underlying microservices. This means that clients interact with a single GraphQL API, which then fetches and aggregates data from various microservices. This abstraction layer hides the complexity of the underlying architecture from clients, making the transition from a monolithic system smoother and less disruptive.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at this example using Tailcall:\\n\\n```graphql\\nschema {\\n  query: Query\\n}\\n\\ntype Query {\\n  users(id: Int!): User\\n    @http(\\n      baseURL: \\"https://users.example.com\\"\\n      path: \\"/users/{{.args.id}}\\"\\n    )\\n}\\n\\ntype User {\\n  id: Int!\\n  name: String!\\n  orders: [Order]\\n    @http(\\n      baseURL: \\"https://orders.example.com\\"\\n      path: \\"/users/{{.value.id}/orders\\"\\n    )\\n}\\n\\ntype Order {\\n  id: Int!\\n  userId: Int!\\n  total: Int!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this specification, the services that handle user accounts and store orders may be separate, while offering data for both under a unified API. This allows for a gradual migration of services without disrupting the client interface. Clients can continue to interact with the GraphQL API, even as the underlying services evolve.\\n\\n### Efficient Data Fetching\\n\\nIn microservice architectures, data is often spread across multiple services. GraphQL\u2019s ability to request only the data needed in a single query reduces the need for multiple round trips to different services, improving performance and reducing latency.\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  users {\\n    orders {\\n      total\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis query fetches only the `total` of each user\'s order, optimizing the data transfer and reducing the load on the network.\\n\\n### Schema Stitching and Federation\\n\\nGraphQL supports schema stitching and federation, which allow you to combine multiple GraphQL schemas into a single schema. This is particularly useful in microservice architectures, where each service might expose its own GraphQL schema. By stitching these schemas together, you can present a unified API to clients, further simplifying the migration process.\\n\\n```graphql\\nextend type Order {\\n  sellerId: Int!\\n  seller: Seller @http(path: \\"/sellers/{{.value.sellerId}}\\")\\n}\\n\\ntype Seller {\\n  id: Int!\\n  name: String!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Order` type is extended with a `seller` field, which could be fetched from a separate microservice for seller accounts, all integrated into a single schema.\\n\\n### Gradual Migration Support\\n\\nOne of the most significant advantages of using GraphQL in your migration strategy is its support for gradual migration. You can introduce **_a GraphQL layer on top of your existing monolithic system and then incrementally refactor parts of the monolith into microservices_**. The GraphQL layer can continue to serve clients, even as the underlying architecture evolves, minimizing disruption to users.\\n\\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Using GraphQL in Your Migration\\n\\n### Analyze Your Monolith\\n\\nBegin by analyzing your monolithic application to identify the domains and boundaries within the codebase. This will help you determine how to decompose the monolith into microservices. Look for areas of the code that are highly coupled and those that are relatively isolated.\\n\\n### Implement GraphQL Layer\\n\\nImplement a GraphQL API that sits on top of your monolithic application. This API will serve as the single point of entry for clients, allowing you to start refactoring the monolith without disrupting the client interface.\\n\\n### Design Your Microservice Architecture\\n\\nNext, design your microservice architecture based on the analysis. Define the services, their boundaries, and how they will communicate with each other. Ensure that each service is aligned with a specific business function or domain to maintain cohesion.\\n\\n### Migrate Services Incrementally\\n\\nStart migrating functionalities from the monolith to microservices incrementally. As you extract services, update the GraphQL layer to fetch data from the newly created microservices instead of the monolith. This approach allows for a smooth transition with minimal impact on the end users.\\n\\n### Test and Optimize\\n\\nThroughout the migration process, continuously test the GraphQL API to ensure it functions correctly with both the monolithic and microservices-based backends. Optimize the GraphQL queries to ensure they are efficient and do not introduce unnecessary latency.\\n\\n![Steps to Gradually migrate Monolith to Microservices leveraging GraphQL](../static/images/blog/monolith-to-microservices.png)\\n\\n## Best Practices for GraphQL in Microservices Migration\\n\\n### Use Strong Type System\\n\\nLeverage GraphQL\u2019s strong typing to ensure your API is well-defined and less prone to errors. Define your types and schema carefully to ensure they align with your domain model and business logic.\\n\\n### Implement Proper Error Handling\\n\\nEnsure that your GraphQL API has robust error handling in place. Provide meaningful error messages to clients and ensure that failures in one microservice do not cascade and affect the entire API.\\n\\n### Optimize Performance with Caching\\n\\nImplement caching strategies within your GraphQL layer to improve performance. This can be done at various levels, including query result caching, response caching, and even partial query caching.\\n\\n### Ensure Security Measures\\n\\nSecurity is critical when migrating to microservices, especially when introducing a new API layer like GraphQL. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Additionally, consider rate limiting, input validation, and other security best practices to protect your GraphQL API.\\n\\n## Successful Migration Stories Using GraphQL\\n\\n### Netflix\\n\\nIn 2021, Netflix published a [blog post](https://netflixtechblog.com/beyond-rest-1b76f7c20ef6) detailing the company\u2019s adoption of GraphQL. Netflix encountered performance challenges as it expanded globally, requiring a more efficient way to manage data interactions between microservices. By integrating GraphQL as a central data layer, Netflix reduced the number of network requests and minimized data transfer, significantly lowering latency. This improvement allowed Netflix to deliver content more efficiently, maintaining high customer satisfaction across a growing user base.\\n\\n### GitHub\\n\\nGitHub needed a more flexible and user-friendly API to meet increasing demands. By adopting GraphQL, they replaced their monolithic REST API with a single, unified API layer, allowing developers [to query only the data they needed](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/about-the-graphql-api). This transition improved efficiency, reduced the complexity of API version management, and enabled GitHub to introduce new features more seamlessly.\\n\\n### Airbnb\\n\\nAirbnb faced inefficiencies with its monolithic architecture, as multiple REST API calls were needed to fetch data, leading to slow response times. In response, they entered [a close partnership with Apollo](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/12/airbnb-graphql-migration/). By implementing GraphQL as a unified data layer on top of their microservices, Airbnb reduced the number of API calls and improved performance. This allowed for more effective scaling and a better user experience while enabling independent development across teams.\\n\\n### Shopify\\n\\nShopify\'s monolithic REST API became a bottleneck as their platform grew in complexity. To address this, [they introduced GraphQL to their tech stack](https://thenewstack.io/why-shopify-favors-graphql-over-rest-for-its-apis/), which provided a more flexible and powerful API. This enabled developers to request exactly the data they needed, improving efficiency and supporting larger merchants. The strong typing and introspection features of GraphQL also enhanced API documentation, fostering greater innovation among developers.\\n\\n### Pinterest\\n\\nPinterest needed to scale its monolithic architecture while continuing to innovate. They used GraphQL as an intermediary layer during their migration to microservices, [allowing for a gradual transition](https://graphql.org/conf/2024/schedule/515c8ade2da6e1fc710e87df182dd8e6/) without disrupting the user experience. This approach enabled Pinterest to decouple its front end from the back end, facilitating independent development and smoother scaling.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nMigrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices is a complex but rewarding process. By leveraging GraphQL, organizations can ease the transition, maintain a consistent API for clients, and gradually refactor their systems without significant disruption. The flexibility and efficiency of GraphQL make it a powerful tool for navigating the challenges of modern software architecture.\\n\\n[Contact us today](https://tailcall.run/contact/) to learn more about how Tailcall can help you overcome Monolith to Microservices Migration challenges using GraphQL.\\n\\n<CallToAction\\ntitle=\\"Simplify your Microservices migration with Tailcall\\"\\nsubtitle= \\"Try Tailcall today\\"\\nbuttonText=\\"Get Started\\"\\nbackgroundImageSrc=\\"/icons/basic/bg-tailcall.svg\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### What is the main advantage of using GraphQL in microservices migration?\\n\\nGraphQL provides a unified API layer that abstracts the complexity of the underlying microservices, allowing for a smoother and less disruptive migration process.\\n\\n### Can I use GraphQL with existing REST APIs?\\n\\nYes, GraphQL can be layered on top of existing REST APIs, allowing you to gradually transition to a more flexible API architecture.\\n\\n### Is GraphQL secure?\\n\\nYes, but it requires proper security measures such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting to ensure that the API is protected from threats.\\n\\n### How does GraphQL improve performance in microservices?\\n\\nGraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need in a single query, reducing the number of round trips and the amount of data transferred over the network."},{"id":"api-strategy","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/api-strategy","source":"@site/blog/api-strategy-2024-08-13.md","title":"API Strategy: Driving Innovation and Growth in Modern Business","description":"Learn how a well-defined API strategy can drive innovation, improve efficiency, and create new opportunities for growth in modern businesses.","date":"2024-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"API","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"inline":true,"label":"Strategy","permalink":"/blog/tags/strategy"},{"inline":true,"label":"GraphQL","permalink":"/blog/tags/graph-ql"},{"inline":true,"label":"Scalability","permalink":"/blog/tags/scalability"}],"readingTime":6.415,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"API Strategy: Driving Innovation and Growth in Modern Business","authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"description":"Learn how a well-defined API strategy can drive innovation, improve efficiency, and create new opportunities for growth in modern businesses.","hide_table_of_contents":true,"image":"/images/blog/api-strategy.png","slug":"api-strategy","tags":["API","Strategy","GraphQL","Scalability"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Simplify your monolith to microservices migration using GraphQL","permalink":"/blog/graphql-microservices-migration"},"nextItem":{"title":"How Tailcall statically identifies N+1 issues in GraphQL","permalink":"/blog/tailcall-n+1-identification-algorithm"}},"content":"import CallToAction from \'../src/components/blog/call-to-action.tsx\';\\n\\nAs I reflect on the evolution of APIs, I am reminded of **Jeff Bezos\' famous 2002 mandate** to his IT organization at Amazon.\\n\\nThe CEO\'s directive to expose data and functionality through service interfaces, and to design these interfaces to be externalizable, was a game-changer.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![Jeff Bezos\' mandate](../static/images/blog/bezos_api_mandate.png)\\n\\nFast-forward to today, and APIs have become the backbone of modern business, with even the smallest companies having hundreds of APIs.\\n\\nHowever, the landscape has shifted dramatically. Having good APIs is no longer enough; we need a strategy for APIs.\\nHaving good APIs is indeed a crucial starting point, but it\'s only the beginning. A well-designed API can provide a solid foundation for your business, but without a comprehensive strategy, you risk missing out on opportunities for growth, innovation, and efficiency.\\n\\nA strategy for APIs involves considering the entire API lifecycle, from design and development to deployment, management, and maintenance. It requires a deep understanding of your business goals, target audience, and the role APIs play in achieving those goals.\\n\\nIn 2024, API strategy needs to be defined at the sub-API level, not just at the company level. This is where the rubber meets the road, and businesses must adapt to stay ahead of the curve.\\n\\n## What is an API Strategy?\\n\\nAn API strategy is an outline of the steps needed to design, develop, and manage APIs effectively. It\'s no longer just about having good APIs; it\'s about ensuring they are secure, scalable, and reliable. It\'s about making sure developers are more productive and machine utilization is more efficient. In essence, API strategy is about abstracting cross-cutting concerns from business logic.\\nAbstracting cross-cutting concerns from business logic is a critical aspect of API strategy. Cross-cutting concerns refer to functionalities that are essential to the operation of your API but are not directly related to the business logic. Examples of cross-cutting concerns include:\\n\\n- **Security**: authentication, authorization, and encryption\\n- **Monitoring**: logging, analytics, and error tracking\\n- **Scalability**: rate limiting, caching, and load balancing\\n\\nBy abstracting these concerns from business logic, you can decouple them from the core functionality of your API, making it easier to maintain, update, and scale your API without affecting the underlying business logic.\\n\\nFor instance, if you\'re building an e-commerce API, you might abstract security concerns by implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization. This would allow you to focus on the business logic of processing orders, managing inventory, and handling payments, while ensuring that security is handled separately.\\n\\n## Why Do You Need an API Strategy?\\n\\nThe importance of an API strategy cannot be overstated. Without one, you risk exposing your business to security vulnerabilities, scalability issues, and reliability problems. A well-defined API strategy helps you address critical concerns such as:\\n\\n- Cross-functional collaboration\\n- Rate limiting\\n- Circuit breaking\\n- Caching\\n- Routing\\n- Composition\\n- Access control\\n- Authentication\\n- Versioning\\n- Logging\\n- Monitoring\\n- Documentation\\n\\nHaving a strategy in place ensures that you\'re not just documenting your APIs, but also managing them effectively, securing them, scaling them, monitoring them, and making sure they\'re reliable.\\n\\n## The Role of Tools in API Strategy\\n\\nThere are many tools available in the market to help with API strategy, such as API gateways and Swagger. An API gateway can help with rate limiting, caching, routing, access control, authentication, authorization, logging, and monitoring. Swagger can assist with documentation. However, are these tools enough? Are they capable of addressing all the challenges that come with API strategy? Let\'s discuss.\\n\\n### API Composition: A Critical Aspect of API Strategy\\n\\nAPI composition is a critical aspect of API strategy. How do you compose your APIs? Do you use an API gateway or a different tool? How do you prevent the [N+1 problem](/docs/graphql-n-plus-one-problem-solved-tailcall/#what-is-the-n1-problem) when composing APIs using an API gateway? How do you handle the failure of one of the APIs in the composition? How do you handle caching in the composition? These are just a few of the questions that need to be addressed in your API strategy.\\n\\n### Access Control: A Key Consideration\\n\\nAccess control is another key consideration in API strategy. Can you create an API and use it as both a public API and an admin API, restricting access to fields based on user role? The answer is no, not without a well-defined API strategy.\\n\\n## A Solution to API Strategy Challenges\\n\\nFor having a well-defined API strategy, you need a set of tools that can help you with the above points. Such a solution should have first-class support for:\\n\\n- **API Composition:** Easily compose APIs to create complex workflows and integrations.\\n- **Access Control:** Implement fine-grained access control to restrict access to APIs and resources based on user roles and permissions.\\n- **Rate Limiting:** Enforce rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of your APIs.\\n- **Circuit Breaking:** Detect and prevent cascading failures in your API ecosystem.\\n- **Caching:** Improve performance and reduce latency with intelligent caching mechanisms.\\n- **Routing:** Route API requests efficiently and securely to the right backend services.\\n- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to your APIs.\\n- **Versioning:** Manage multiple versions of your APIs and ensure backward compatibility.\\n- **Logging and Monitoring:** Gain visibility into API performance and behavior with real-time logging and monitoring.\\n- **Documentation:** Generate accurate and up-to-date documentation for your APIs.\\n\\nA good solution should also:\\n\\n- **Introspect and detect problems:** Analyze your configurations to identify potential issues and provide recommendations for improvement.\\n- **Transfer type safety:** Ensure that your API configurations are type-safe and consistent with your code.\\n- **Provide access control to the sub-API level:** Restrict access to specific fields in the APIs based on user roles and permissions.\\n\\nBy using such a solution, you can overcome the challenges of API strategy and create a robust, scalable, and secure API ecosystem that drives innovation and growth in your business.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, API strategy is no longer a nice-to-have; it\'s a must-have for businesses that want to stay ahead of the curve. By defining a clear API strategy, businesses can drive innovation, improve efficiency, and create new opportunities for growth.

If not, you\'re in for a treat - check out our [N+1 guide!](/docs/graphql-n-plus-one-problem-solved-tailcall)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nTo summarize, they occur when a GraphQL resolver is called multiple times for a single GraphQL request, leading to a large set of requests upstream and overall slower query execution. In this blog post, we\'ll dive into how Tailcall specifically identifies N+1 issues in GraphQL, and explore the algorithm and data structures used to detect these issues.\\n\\n## High-Level Working\\n\\nUnlike a traditional GraphQL implementation where the resolvers are written by hand, Tailcall encourages developers to take a configuration-driven approach. This has many benefits, and we have talked about them in our previous [blog](./no-code-graphql-2024-05-30.md).\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of not handwriting is the ability to introspect and optimize. Let\'s take an example of two functions written in Rust, though the problem is evident in all general purpose programming languages.\\n\\n```rust\\nconst BASE_URL: &str = \\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\\"\\n\\n// Describes a typical Post returned from the /posts API\\nstruct Post {\\n    id: i32,\\n    user_id: i32\\n    title: String,\\n    body: String,\\n    user: Option<User>\\n}\\n\\n// Describes a typical User object from the /users API\\nstruct User {\\n    id: i32\\n    name: String,\\n    email: String\\n}\\n\\n// Asynchronously retrieves a `User` object by making a GET request using the given `user_id`.\\nasync fn get_user(user_id: i32) -> User {\\n    let response = request(Method::GET, format!(\\"{}/users/{}\\", BASE_URL, user_id)).await;\\n\\n    // Decode the body as a User\\n    decode(response.body)\\n}\\n\\n// Asynchronously fetches and updates posts with user details from the API.\\nasync fn get_posts() -> Vec<Post> {\\n    let response = request(Method::GET, format!(\\"{}/posts\\", BASE_URL)).await;\\n\\n\\n    // Decode the response into a Vec<Post>\\n    let mut posts = decode(response.body)\\n\\n\\n    // Set the actual user by making an HTTP call\\n    for post in posts {\\n        post.user = Some(get_user(post.user_id).await);\\n    }\\n    posts\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou might have identified that there are few issues in the implementation above:\\n\\n1. For each post item we end up making a call for the user independently, there is a clear N+1 issue here.\\n2. It\'s possible that two posts can be written by the same user, and yet we will end up making duplicate calls for the same user.\\n3. All calls to the `/users` API is being made in sequence, even though they can be paralyzed.\\n4. There are multiple points of failure which the above code doesn\'t handle.\\n\\nNow, yes all of these issues can be solved by better coding practices, using a [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) type and using a [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) but that\'s besides the point. The point here is - Semantic analysis of any code is critical to building a robust systems and is only possible with some sort of human intervention typically in the form of code reviews or perhaps using some LLM if you are into that hype. What you can\'t do is - Write an algorithm to identify the N+1 issue in your GraphQL implementation that **100% accurate**.\\n\\nWith a configuration its a completely different story, take the below Tailcall configuration for example:\\n\\n```graphql\\nschema\\n  @upstream(\\n    baseURL: \\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\\"\\n  ) {\\n  query: Query\\n}\\n\\ntype Query {\\n  posts: [Post] @http(path: \\"/posts\\")\\n}\\n\\ntype Post {\\n  id: ID!\\n  userId: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  body: String!\\n  user: User @http(path: \\"/users{{.value.userId}}\\")\\n}\\n\\ntype User {\\n  id: ID\\n  name: String\\n  email: String\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s simple, expressive and doesn\'t expose the guts of how data will be queried, batched, deduped, parsed etc. Sure, configurations take away flexibility from writing anything but in return it liberates you from a ton of such nitty gritties of building a robust software system. The above configuration file can be parsed, validated and semantically analyzed accurately to identify issues such as N+1 very precisely using the [check](/docs/tailcall-graphql-cli/#check) command as follows:\\n\\n![Actual Usage Image](../static/images/blog/n+1-image-terminal.png)\\n\\n## The Algorithm\\n\\nTailcall reads your [configuration](/docs/tailcall-graphql-configuration-format-conversion), parses it, and internally stores it in an efficient graph data-structure that resembles a `HashMap`. This allows `O(1)` access to a GraphQL type which represented as a node by its name. Once the graph data-structure is ready we make it go through a series of validators, one of them being the **N+1 tracker**.\\n\\nNow, here\'s where it gets fascinating. We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, starting at the root query and traversing all the connected nodes. Let me walk you through this cool process:\\n\\n1. Initialize two variables to track the currently traversed `path` and `visited` fields so that we can avoid cycles.\\n2. Start at the root query and begin traversing the graph data structure.\\n3. For each field in the current node, check if it has a resolver and is not batched. We know if the node contains a resolver if that node has a [`@http`](/docs/tailcall-dsl-graphql-custom-directives#http-directive) or a [`@grpc`](/docs/tailcall-dsl-graphql-custom-directives#grpc-directive). Tailcall supports powerful batching primitives and if a field uses a Batch API, then that resolver is whitelisted and dropped from the list of potential N+1 candidates.\\n4. If the field has a resolver and is not batched, and the current path contains a list, then the current path is added to the result.\\n5. Otherwise, we recursively traverse the graph data structure, updating the current path and visited fields as necessary.\\n6. If a cycle is detected, return the cached result instead of re-traversing the path.\\n7. Once the traversal is complete, return the result, which represents the identified N+1 issues.\\n\\nThis algorithm allows Tailcall to efficiently identify potential N+1 issues across your entire GraphQL schema, even in complex, deeply nested structures.\\n\\n:::tip\\nTo see the actual implementation you can check out the [tracker.rs](https://github.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/blob/main/src/core/config/npo/tracker.rs) implementation.\\n:::\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nWhile starting, Tailcall automatically performs these validations and one of our users complained that it would take around 5 minutes to start the server for their configuration which was around 10,000 lines. This caught our attention! The thing is, finding N+1 issues is a complex dynamic-programming problem. All this while our team has been focused on [benchmarking](https://github.com/tailcallhq/graphql-benchmarks) and optimizing the runtime performance of the server. This was the first time perhaps that we were surprised to see such a degradation in performance. We quickly realized that this is a dynamic programming problem and there are certain tricks to make such algorithms efficient. For us, it boiled down to two key optimizations:\\n\\n### 1. Memoization\\n\\nOur algorithm uses a cache to store the results of previous traversals. The cache is used to avoid re-traversing the same path multiple times. It\'s essentially memoization however is super critical if you have a huge configuration that you\'d want to validate.\\n\\n### 2. Chunk Data Structure\\n\\nLet me introduce you to our secret weapon: a special yet simple data structure that we affectionately call \\"Chunk\\". It\'s a game-changer for storing and manipulating query paths. The chunk data structure is implemented as an enum with three variants:\\n\\n```rust\\nenum Chunk<A> {\\n    Empty,\\n    Append(A, Rc<Chunk<A>>),\\n    Concat(Rc<Chunk<A>>, Rc<Chunk<A>>)\\n}\\n\\nimpl<A> Chunk<A> {\\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\\n        Self::Empty\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn is_null(&self) -> bool {\\n        matches!(self, Chunk::Empty)\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn append(self, a: A) -> Self {\\n        Chunk::Append(a, Rc::new(self))\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn concat(self, other: Chunk<A>) -> Self {\\n        if self.is_null() {\\n            return other;\\n        }\\n        if other.is_null() {\\n            return self;\\n        }\\n        Self::Concat(Rc::new(self), Rc::new(other))\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn as_vec(&self) -> Vec<&A> {\\n        // ... converts the chunk into a vec\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n| **Variant** |                                                               |\\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| **Nil**     | Represents an empty chunk                                     |\\n| **Append**  | Represents an append operation performed on an existing chunk |\\n| **Concat**  | Represents the concatenation of two chunks                    |\\n\\nThe chunk data structure has the following properties:\\n\\n- `O(1)` complexity for append and concat operations.\\n- Uses Reference Counting instead of Boxing to make cloning faster.\\n- Can be converted to a vector of references to the elements in the chunk.\\n\\nYou can clearly see that we don\'t actually perform an append or a concat operation instead we store a representation of that operation. This is a significant optimization because while performing the DFS, we create a lot of temporary query paths. However with the chunk data structure we don\'t need to allocate any additional memory on the heap or perform any form of wasted computation for paths that don\'t produce an N+1 query.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nLastly to ensure that we are always correct and no N+1 issues go unidentified we perform tests with actual configurations.\\n\\n![Source Code Screenshot](../static/images/blog/github-npo-screenshot.png)\\n\\nHopefully, this peek behind the curtain gives you some insight into how Tailcall identifies N+1 issues in your GraphQL configuration.

If you\'ve ever felt like you\'re battling an octopus to retrieve the data you need, then GraphQL is here to be your data fetching hero!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nGraphQL empowers you to take control of your data requests in Vue.js, ensuring you receive only the specific data your application requires. This translates to cleaner code, faster performance, and a more delightful developer experience.\\n\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we\'ll unveil the top 5 approaches to seamlessly integrate GraphQL into your Vue projects. It\'s like opening a treasure chest overflowing with powerful data fetching techniques!\\n\\nWhether you\'re a GraphQL novice or a seasoned pro, this blog post caters to all skill levels. We\'ll delve into each method, providing in-depth explanations, clear comparisons, and practical error handling strategies. Buckle up and prepare to transform into a data-fetching superhero with the power of GraphQL!\\n\\nReady to elevate your Vue development experience? Let\'s dive in!\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Project Setup\\n\\nLet\'s start by setting up our Vue project with Vite, which provides a faster and leaner development experience:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm create vite@latest vue-graphql-tailcall-showcase -- --template vue-ts\\ncd vue-graphql-tailcall-showcase\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\nThis creates a new Vue 3 project with TypeScript support. Now, let\'s install the necessary dependencies for our GraphQL experiments:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @apollo/client @vue/apollo-composable graphql\\nnpm install @urql/vue\\nnpm install axios\\nnpm install villus\\n```\\n\\nThese installations will allow us to explore different GraphQL client options in our Vue application.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd27 Tailcall Backend Configuration\\n\\nNow, let\'s set up our Tailcall backend that will wrap the JSONPlaceholder API, providing a GraphQL interface to RESTful data.\\n\\nFirst, create a `tailcall` directory in the project root:\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir tailcall\\n```\\n\\nThen, create a `jsonplaceholder.graphql` file in this directory:\\n\\n```graphql\\n# File: tailcall/jsonplaceholder.graphql\\n\\nschema\\n  @server(port: 8000, hostname: \\"0.0.0.0\\")\\n  @upstream(\\n    baseURL: \\"http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\\"\\n    httpCache: 42\\n  ) {\\n  query: Query\\n}\\n\\ntype Query {\\n  posts: [Post] @http(path: \\"/posts\\")\\n  user(id: Int!): User @http(path: \\"/users/{{.args.id}}\\")\\n}\\n\\ntype User {\\n  id: Int!\\n  name: String!\\n  username: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  phone: String\\n  website: String\\n}\\n\\ntype Post {\\n  id: Int!\\n  userId: Int!\\n  title: String!\\n  body: String!\\n  user: User @http(path: \\"/users/{{.value.userId}}\\")\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis GraphQL schema defines our API structure, mapping RESTful endpoints to GraphQL types and queries.\\n\\nTo start the Tailcall server, you\'ll need to have Tailcall installed. If you haven\'t installed it yet, follow the installation instructions from the Tailcall documentation. Once installed, you can start the server with:\\n\\n```sh\\ntailcall start ./tailcall/jsonplaceholder.graphql\\n```\\n\\nThis command starts a GraphQL server on `http://localhost:8000`, which will act as a bridge between our Vue application and the JSONPlaceholder API.\\n\\nWith this setup, we\'re ready to dive into the exciting world of GraphQL in Vue! \ud83d\ude80 Our Tailcall backend provides a perfect playground for exploring different GraphQL client approaches, allowing us to fetch posts and user data with the flexibility and power of GraphQL queries. In the following sections, we\'ll explore how to leverage this backend with various GraphQL clients in our Vue application. Get ready for some data-fetching magic! \u2728\\n\\nAlright, let\'s dive into our first approach: Apollo Client! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## Apollo Client - The Swiss Army Knife of GraphQL\\n\\nApollo Client stands out in the GraphQL ecosystem due to its comprehensive feature set, including intelligent caching, real-time updates, and optimistic UI rendering. For Vue developers working on data-intensive applications, Apollo Client provides a sophisticated approach to state management and data fetching.\\n\\n### 1. Setting Up Apollo Client in a Vue.js Project\\n\\nBegin by installing the necessary packages:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @apollo/client @vue/apollo-composable graphql\\n```\\n\\n#### Configuration\\n\\nSet up Apollo Client in your Vue application:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// src/apollo.ts\\nimport {\\n  ApolloClient,\\n  InMemoryCache,\\n  createHttpLink,\\n} from \\"@apollo/client/core\\"\\n\\nconst httpLink = createHttpLink({\\n  uri: \\"https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql\\",\\n})\\n\\nexport const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({\\n  link: httpLink,\\n  cache: new InMemoryCache(),\\n  defaultOptions: {\\n    watchQuery: {\\n      fetchPolicy: \\"cache-and-network\\",\\n    },\\n  },\\n})\\n\\n// main.ts\\nimport {createApp, provide, h} from \\"vue\\"\\nimport {DefaultApolloClient} from \\"@vue/apollo-composable\\"\\nimport App from \\"./App.vue\\"\\nimport {apolloClient} from \\"./apollo\\"\\n\\nconst app = createApp({\\n  setup() {\\n    provide(DefaultApolloClient, apolloClient)\\n  },\\n  render: () => h(App),\\n})\\n\\napp.mount(\\"#app\\")\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration creates an Apollo Client instance with a default in-memory cache and provides it to the entire Vue application.\\n\\n### 2. Executing Queries with Apollo Client\\n\\nApollo Client provides the `useQuery` composable for executing GraphQL queries. Here\'s an example of fetching a list of posts:\\n\\n```html\\n<script setup lang=\\"ts\\">\\n  import {useQuery} from \\"@vue/apollo-composable\\"\\n  import gql from \\"graphql-tag\\"\\n  import {computed} from \\"vue\\"\\n\\n  interface Post {\\n    id: number\\n    title: string\\n    body: string\\n    user: {\\n      name: string\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  const GET_POSTS = gql`\\n    query GetPosts($limit: Int!) {\\n      posts(limit: $limit) {\\n        id\\n        title\\n        body\\n        user {\\n          name\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  `\\n\\n  const {result, loading, error, refetch} = useQuery<{\\n    posts: Post[]\\n  }>(GET_POSTS, {\\n    limit: 10,\\n  })\\n\\n  const posts = computed(() => result.value?.posts || [])\\n\\n  const fetchPosts = () => {\\n    refetch()\\n  }\\n<\/script>\\n\\n<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <button @click=\\"fetchPosts\\" :disabled=\\"loading\\">\\n      Fetch Posts\\n    </button>\\n    <div v-if=\\"loading\\">Loading...</div>\\n    <ul v-else-if=\\"posts.length\\">\\n      <li v-for=\\"post in posts\\" :key=\\"post.id\\">\\n        {{ post.title }} by {{ post.user.name }}\\n      </li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <div v-else-if=\\"error\\">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\nThis example demonstrates:\\n\\n1. Defining a GraphQL query using `gql` tag\\n2. Using the `useQuery` composable to manage the query execution\\n3. Handling loading, error, and success states\\n4. Implementing a refetch mechanism for manual query execution\\n\\n### 3. Mutations and Optimistic Updates\\n\\nApollo Client supports GraphQL mutations with optimistic updates for responsive UIs:\\n\\n```html\\n<script setup lang=\\"ts\\">\\n  import {useMutation} from \\"@vue/apollo-composable\\"\\n  import gql from \\"graphql-tag\\"\\n  import {ref} from \\"vue\\"\\n\\n  const CREATE_POST = gql`\\n    mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $body: String!) {\\n      createPost(input: {title: $title, body: $body}) {\\n        id\\n        title\\n        body\\n      }\\n    }\\n  `\\n\\n  const {\\n    mutate: createPost,\\n    loading,\\n    error,\\n  } = useMutation(CREATE_POST)\\n\\n  const title = ref(\\"\\")\\n  const body = ref(\\"\\")\\n\\n  const submitPost = async () => {\\n    try {\\n      const {data} = await createPost(\\n        {\\n          title: title.value,\\n          body: body.value,\\n        },\\n        {\\n          optimisticResponse: {\\n            createPost: {\\n              __typename: \\"Post\\",\\n              id: \\"temp-id\\",\\n              title: title.value,\\n              body: body.value,\\n            },\\n          },\\n          update: (cache, {data}) => {\\n            // Update cache logic here\\n          },\\n        },\\n      )\\n      console.log(\\"Post created:\\", data.createPost)\\n      // Reset form\\n      title.value = \\"\\"\\n      body.value = \\"\\"\\n    } catch (e) {\\n      console.error(\\"Error creating post:\\", e)\\n    }\\n  }\\n<\/script>\\n\\n<template>\\n  <form @submit.prevent=\\"submitPost\\">\\n    <input v-model=\\"title\\" placeholder=\\"Title\\" required />\\n    <textarea\\n      v-model=\\"body\\"\\n      placeholder=\\"Body\\"\\n      required\\n    ></textarea>\\n    <button type=\\"submit\\" :disabled=\\"loading\\">\\n      Create Post\\n    </button>\\n    <div v-if=\\"error\\">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>\\n  </form>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\nThis example showcases:\\n\\n1. Defining a GraphQL mutation\\n2. Using the `useMutation` composable\\n3. Implementing optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback\\n4. Handling form submission and mutation execution\\n\\n### 4. Advanced Apollo Client Features\\n\\n### Caching and Normalization\\n\\nApollo Client\'s normalized cache is a powerful feature for efficient data management:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {InMemoryCache, makeVar} from \\"@apollo/client/core\\"\\n\\nexport const cache = new InMemoryCache({\\n  typePolicies: {\\n    Query: {\\n      fields: {\\n        posts: {\\n          merge(existing, incoming) {\\n            return incoming\\n          },\\n        },\\n      },\\n    },\\n    Post: {\\n      fields: {\\n        isLiked: {\\n          read() {\\n            return likedPostsVar().includes(this.id)\\n          },\\n        },\\n      },\\n    },\\n  },\\n})\\n\\nexport const likedPostsVar = makeVar<number[]>([])\\n```\\n\\nThis setup demonstrates:\\n\\n1. Custom merge functions for query results\\n2. Computed fields based on reactive variables\\n3. Using reactive variables for local state management\\n\\n#### Error Handling and Retry Logic\\n\\nImplement robust error handling and retry logic:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {ApolloLink} from \\"@apollo/client/core\\"\\nimport {onError} from \\"@apollo/client/link/error\\"\\nimport {RetryLink} from \\"@apollo/client/link/retry\\"\\n\\nconst errorLink = onError(\\n  ({graphQLErrors, networkError}) => {\\n    if (graphQLErrors)\\n      graphQLErrors.forEach(({message, locations, path}) =>\\n        console.log(\\n          `[GraphQL error]: Message: ${message}, Location: ${locations}, Path: ${path}`,\\n        ),\\n      )\\n    if (networkError)\\n      console.log(`[Network error]: ${networkError}`)\\n  },\\n)\\n\\nconst retryLink = new RetryLink({\\n  delay: {\\n    initial: 300,\\n    max: Infinity,\\n    jitter: true,\\n  },\\n  attempts: {\\n    max: 5,\\n    retryIf: (error, _operation) => !!error,\\n  },\\n})\\n\\nconst link = ApolloLink.from([\\n  errorLink,\\n  retryLink,\\n  httpLink,\\n])\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration adds comprehensive error logging and automatic retry for failed requests.\\n\\n### 5. Performance Optimization\\n\\nTo optimize performance when using Apollo Client with Vue:\\n\\n1. **Implement pagination** for large datasets:\\n\\n   ```html\\n   <script setup lang=\\"ts\\">\\n     import {useQuery} from \\"@vue/apollo-composable\\"\\n     import gql from \\"graphql-tag\\"\\n     import {ref, computed} from \\"vue\\"\\n\\n     const GET_POSTS = gql`\\n       query GetPosts($offset: Int!, $limit: Int!) {\\n         posts(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {\\n           id\\n           title\\n         }\\n       }\\n     `\\n\\n     const limit = ref(10)\\n     const offset = ref(0)\\n\\n     const {result, loading, fetchMore} = useQuery(\\n       GET_POSTS,\\n       () => ({\\n         offset: offset.value,\\n         limit: limit.value,\\n       }),\\n     )\\n\\n     const posts = computed(() => result.value?.posts || [])\\n\\n     const loadMore = () => {\\n       offset.value += limit.value\\n       fetchMore({\\n         variables: {\\n           offset: offset.value,\\n           limit: limit.value,\\n         },\\n       })\\n     }\\n   <\/script>\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Use fragments** for reusable query parts:\\n\\n   ```typescript\\n   import gql from \\"graphql-tag\\"\\n\\n   export const POST_FRAGMENT = gql`\\n     fragment PostDetails on Post {\\n       id\\n       title\\n       body\\n       createdAt\\n     }\\n   `\\n\\n   export const GET_POSTS = gql`\\n     ${POST_FRAGMENT}\\n     query GetPosts {\\n       posts {\\n         ...PostDetails\\n       }\\n     }\\n   `\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Leverage Apollo Client DevTools** for performance monitoring and cache inspection.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nApollo Client provides a powerful and flexible solution for integrating GraphQL into Vue.js applications.

This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and complying with healthcare regulations.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenapi: 3.0.0\\ninfo:\\n  title: Healthcare API\\n  version: 1.0.0\\npaths:\\n  /patients/{id}:\\n    get:\\n      summary: Get patient details\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: id\\n          in: path\\n          required: true\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n      responses:\\n        \\"200\\":\\n          description: A patient object\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                $ref: \\"#/components/schemas/Patient\\"\\ncomponents:\\n  schemas:\\n    Patient:\\n      type: object\\n      properties:\\n        id:\\n          type: string\\n        name:\\n          type: string\\n        age:\\n          type: integer\\n        medicalHistory:\\n          type: array\\n          items:\\n            type: string\\n```\\n\\nBy understanding the strengths and practical applications of GraphQL and OpenAPI, developers can make informed decisions that align with their project\'s specific needs. GraphQL excels in scenarios requiring real-time updates and flexible data retrieval, while OpenAPI shines in environments where standardization, security, and extensive documentation are crucial.\\n\\n## Performance and Scalability\\n\\n### Performance Considerations\\n\\n#### Response Time and Data Fetching Efficiency\\n\\nLet\'s dive deeper into the performance implications of GraphQL vs OpenAPI.\\n\\nWith GraphQL, the ability to request only needed fields can significantly reduce payload sizes. For example, if you\'re building a mobile app that displays a list of products, you might only need the product name, price, and thumbnail image. In a REST API, you might get all product details including lengthy descriptions, inventory data, etc. This extra data increases the payload size and parsing time on mobile devices.\\n\\nHere\'s a concrete example:\\n\\n**REST API response (over-fetching):**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"id\\": 1,\\n  \\"name\\": \\"Smartphone X\\",\\n  \\"price\\": 999.99,\\n  \\"description\\": \\"A very long description...\\",\\n  \\"inventory\\": 500,\\n  \\"categoryId\\": 5,\\n  \\"brandId\\": 3,\\n  \\"specs\\": { ... },\\n  \\"reviews\\": [ ... ],\\n  \\"relatedProducts\\": [ ... ]\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nGraphQL query and response (precise data):\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  product(id: 1) {\\n    name\\n    price\\n    thumbnailUrl\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"data\\": {\\n    \\"product\\": {\\n      \\"name\\": \\"Smartphone X\\",\\n      \\"price\\": 999.99,\\n      \\"thumbnailUrl\\": \\"https://example.com/thumb.jpg\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe GraphQL response is much smaller, leading to faster load times, especially on slower networks.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s not all roses for GraphQL. Complex queries can put a heavier load on your database. For instance, a deeply nested query fetching users, their posts, comments on those posts, and information about the comment authors could result in multiple joins or separate database queries. This is where techniques like DataLoader (for batching and caching) become crucial in GraphQL implementations.\\n\\nOn the OpenAPI side, while over-fetching can be an issue, it also allows for easier caching at the network level (CDNs, reverse proxies) because the responses for a given URL are consistent. Additionally, for simple CRUD operations, the RESTful approach can be more straightforward to implement and may perform better out of the box.\\n\\n### Scalability Challenges\\n\\n#### Handling High Traffic and Data Complexity\\n\\nGraphQL\'s flexibility is both a blessing and a curse. While it allows for precise data retrieval, it can lead to complex queries that are tough to optimize. Think of it like asking for a custom sandwich with 20 specific ingredients at a busy deli \u2013 it can bog down the line. On the other hand, OpenAPI\'s structured endpoints are more like standard menu items \u2013 easier to prepare and scale but might require more trips to get everything you want.\\n\\n## Security Implications\\n\\n### Security Challenges in GraphQL\\n\\nGraphQL, with its dynamic nature, brings unique security challenges and opportunities for enhancement. Let\'s explore these and see how to keep our APIs safe.\\n\\n#### Challenges and Mitigation Strategies\\n\\n1. **Exposure of Sensitive Data**: GraphQL\'s power can also be its Achilles\' heel if sensitive data isn\'t properly protected.\\n\\n   - **Field-Level Authorization**: Just like a VIP section in a club, only certain users should have access to specific data fields. Implement fine-grained access controls based on user roles and permissions.\\n   - **Schema Introspection Control**: Imagine giving a burglar a map of your house. To prevent attackers from discovering your schema, restrict or disable introspection in production environments. Read more about [securing GraphQL APIs](https://tailcall.run/blog/graphql-introspection-security/).\\n\\n2. **Query Complexity and Abuse**: GraphQL queries can become deeply nested, leading to performance issues and potential denial-of-service attacks. It\'s like a never-ending story that overloads your server.\\n\\n   - **Query Complexity Analysis**: Use tools to analyze and limit query complexity, ensuring they don\'t overload the server. Think of it as having a bouncer who stops overly complicated orders.\\n   - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to control the number of queries a client can execute within a given timeframe. It\'s like having a doorman who ensures not too many guests enter at once.\\n\\n3. **Injection Attacks**: GraphQL is vulnerable to injection attacks if inputs aren\'t properly sanitized.\\n   - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Always validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks. It\'s akin to screening all guests before letting them into the party.\\n   - **Use of Parameterized Queries**: Where applicable, use parameterized queries to avoid injection vulnerabilities. This ensures the data is handled safely and securely.\\n\\n### Security Features in OpenAPI\\n\\nOpenAPI comes with a range of built-in mechanisms to bolster security. Let\'s dive into these robust features.\\n\\n#### Built-in Mechanisms and Enhancements\\n\\n1. **Authentication and Authorization**: OpenAPI supports various authentication methods out of the box, ensuring secure access to your APIs.\\n   - **OAuth2**: A robust and flexible framework for authentication and authorization, akin to having a secure, multi-factor locked door.\\n   - **API Keys**: Simple and effective for identifying and authenticating API consumers. Think of it as a personal access card.\\n   - **Basic and Bearer Auth**: Standard methods for securing API endpoints, much like having a key to a specific room.\\n2. **Data Validation**: OpenAPI uses JSON Schema for defining request and response structures, ensuring data integrity.\\n\\n   - **Schema Validation**: All incoming and outgoing data adheres to predefined schemas, reducing the risk of malformed requests and responses. It\'s like having a quality control check before anything leaves the factory.\\n\\n3. **Security Definitions and Requirements**: OpenAPI allows you to define security requirements at both global and individual operation levels, ensuring consistent enforcement of security policies across your API.\\n\\n## Developer Experience\\n\\n### Learning Curve and Accessibility\\n\\nThe developer experience difference between GraphQL and OpenAPI goes beyond just the initial learning curve. Let\'s break this down:\\n\\n**GraphQL:**\\n\\n- **Learning Curve:** While GraphQL concepts like schemas, resolvers, and the query language itself take time to master, tools like GraphiQL provide an interactive playground that significantly eases the learning process. Developers can explore the API, auto-complete queries, and see instant results.\\n\\n  [Tailcall](https://tailcall.run) offers a cost-effective solution for migrating to GraphQL. Which easily integrates with your existing REST/gRPC APIs and provides a seamless transition to GraphQL, smoothing the learning curve for developers.\\n\\n- **Tooling:** The GraphQL ecosystem has evolved rapidly. Tools like Apollo Client not only help with querying but also provide powerful caching mechanisms, state management, and optimistic UI updates. Here\'s a quick example of how Apollo Client simplifies data fetching in React:\\n\\n  ```js\\n  const GET_USER = gql`\\n    query GetUser($id: ID!) {\\n      user(id: $id) {\\n        name\\n        email\\n      }\\n    }\\n  `\\n\\n  function UserProfile({userId}) {\\n    const {loading, error, data} = useQuery(GET_USER, {\\n      variables: {id: userId},\\n    })\\n\\n    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>\\n    if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>\\n\\n    return <h1>{data.user.name}</h1>\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\nThis declarative approach to data fetching can significantly simplify frontend code.\\n\\n- **Type Safety:** GraphQL\'s strong typing, when combined with tools like TypeScript, can provide end-to-end type safety from your API to your frontend code, catching errors at compile time.\\n\\n**OpenAPI:**\\n\\n- **Familiarity:** For developers already versed in REST principles, OpenAPI feels like a natural extension. Its structure mirrors typical REST endpoints, making it easier to adopt in existing projects.\\n\\n- **Code Generation:** One of OpenAPI\'s strengths is the ability to generate both server and client code. For example, using a tool like Swagger Codegen, you can generate a fully functional API client in multiple languages from your OpenAPI spec. This can dramatically speed up development and reduce inconsistencies between API documentation and implementation.\\n\\n- **Standardization:** OpenAPI\'s widespread adoption means that many cloud platforms and API gateways natively support OpenAPI specifications. For instance, Azure API Management can import an OpenAPI spec and automatically set up routing, request validation, and even mock responses for testing.\\n\\nIn practice, the choice often comes down to the specific needs of your project and team. GraphQL shines in scenarios with complex, interconnected data and when you need a flexible, powerful query language. OpenAPI excels in scenarios where you need a clear, standards-based approach, especially when working with external partners or in highly regulated environments.\\n\\n#### Comparing the Ease of Adoption\\n\\n1. **GraphQL**:\\n\\n   - **Flexibility and Complexity**: GraphQL\u2019s flexibility in querying data can be initially overwhelming for developers accustomed to REST. Learning to structure queries, manage resolvers, and handle errors can take time.\\n   - **Resources**: Extensive resources, tutorials, and documentation are available, but hands-on experience is crucial for mastering GraphQL.\\n\\n2. **OpenAPI**:\\n   - **Structured and Predictable**: OpenAPI\u2019s structured approach is familiar to developers experienced with REST APIs. The clear definition of endpoints, methods, and data models makes it easier to understand and implement.\\n   - **Tooling**: The extensive tooling and auto-generation capabilities for documentation and client SDKs streamline the development process.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nHaving explored the performance and flexibility of GraphQL and OpenAPI, you now have a clearer understanding of their strengths and limitations in different scenarios. GraphQL shines in situations requiring complex, real-time data interactions, while OpenAPI excels in environments where standardization and extensive documentation are paramount.

Among the myriad of API specifications available, GraphQL and OpenAPI stand out as prominent choices, each offering unique advantages and addressing different needs.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis article is the first part of a comprehensive series aimed at comparing these two powerful specifications. By delving into their origins, core concepts, and key features, we aim to provide a clear understanding of what makes GraphQL and OpenAPI distinct and help you make an informed decision when choosing the right API specification for your project. We will explore their approach to data retrieval, type system and validation, schema definition, API documentation, and development ecosystem.\\n\\n## Overview of GraphQL and OpenAPI\\n\\n### GraphQL\\n\\nImagine having a magical tool that can fetch exactly what you need, no more, no less\u2014GraphQL is just that! Developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, GraphQL is your go-to for flexible, precise API queries. It\'s like a Swiss Army knife for your data needs, making it a favorite among developers.\\n\\n### OpenAPI\\n\\nIf OpenAPI were a tool, it would be a precisely engineered blueprint for a complex machine, where every part (or API endpoint) is clearly defined and meticulously documented. Initially known as Swagger, OpenAPI was created by SmartBear in 2010 and has since become the gold standard for defining RESTful APIs. This structured approach provided clarity and consistency in several of my projects, making the development process smooth and predictable\\n\\n### Importance of Choosing the Right API Specification\\n\\nChoosing between GraphQL and OpenAPI? Buckle up, because this decision will steer your development workflow, performance, scalability, and ultimately, the success of your project. Let\'s dive into their differences and find out which one suits your needs best!\\n\\n### Quick Comparison Table: GraphQL vs OpenAPI at a Glance\\n\\n| Feature           | GraphQL                  | OpenAPI                   |\\n| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |\\n| Data Retrieval    | Query Language           | REST Endpoints            |\\n| Schema Definition | SDL                      | Swagger                   |\\n| API Documentation | Self-Documenting         | Manual/Auto-Generated     |\\n| Typing            | Strong Typing at Runtime | Schema Validation         |\\n| Performance       | Efficient Data Fetching  | Standardized Operations   |\\n| Scalability       | Handles Complex Queries  | Reliable for High Traffic |\\n| Security          | Custom Security Measures | Built-in Mechanisms       |\\n\\n## Understanding the Fundamentals\\n\\n### A. What is GraphQL?\\n\\n#### Definition and Core Features\\n\\nThink of GraphQL as a master chef who takes your order (query) and prepares exactly what you want, without any extras. It\'s a flexible query language for APIs, allowing clients to request precise data and get exactly what they need. [Read More!\\"](/graphql/what-is-graphql/)\\n\\n### B. What is OpenAPI?\\n\\n#### Definition and Core Features\\n\\nInitially known as Swagger, OpenAPI was crafted by SmartBear in 2010 and has since become the go-to standard for defining RESTful APIs. It provides a comprehensive framework for defining APIs, allowing both humans and machines to understand the capabilities of a service without accessing its source code.\\n\\n## Key Differences\\n\\n### A. Approach to Data Retrieval\\n\\n#### GraphQL Query Language vs OpenAPI REST Endpoints\\n\\nGraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the response, making it highly flexible. OpenAPI, on the other hand, relies on predefined endpoints for data retrieval.\\n\\n#### GraphQL: Query Flexibility\\n\\nGraphQL\'s query flexibility is a game-changer for frontend developers. Imagine you\'re building a user profile page that needs to display a user\'s name, email, recent posts, and follower count. With a REST API, you might need to make multiple requests to different endpoints (/user, /posts, /followers) to gather all this data. But with GraphQL, you can request all this information in a single query:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  user(id: \\"123\\") {\\n    name\\n    email\\n    recentPosts(limit: 5) {\\n      title\\n      date\\n    }\\n    followerCount\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis not only reduces the number of network requests but also eliminates over-fetching of data. If you only need the user\'s name and email, you simply omit the other fields from your query. This flexibility allows frontend developers to iterate quickly without waiting for backend changes, significantly speeding up development cycles.\\n\\n#### OpenAPI: Defined Endpoints\\n\\nOpenAPI follows the REST architecture, where each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or action, providing a clear structure but less flexibility.\\n\\n### B. Type System and Validation\\n\\n#### GraphQL: Strong Typing at Runtime\\n\\nGraphQL uses a robust type system to validate queries at runtime, ensuring clients only request valid data and fields. This strong typing mechanism helps prevent errors before they occur by enforcing a strict schema that defines the types of data that can be queried and the relationships between different data entities. By validating queries against this schema, GraphQL ensures that clients can only access the data they are permitted to and that they do so in a predictable manner. This type safety not only improves the reliability of the API but also enhances developer productivity by providing clear, self-documenting APIs.\\n\\nExample GraphQL Schema:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype User {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  posts: [Post]\\n}\\n\\ntype Post {\\n  id: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  content: String!\\n  author: User\\n}\\n\\ntype Query {\\n  user(id: ID!): User\\n  allUsers: [User]\\n  post(id: ID!): Post\\n  allPosts: [Post]\\n}\\n\\ntype Mutation {\\n  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User\\n  createPost(\\n    title: String!\\n    content: String!\\n    authorId: ID!\\n  ): Post\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExample GraphQL Query:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  user(id: \\"123\\") {\\n    id\\n    name\\n    email\\n    posts {\\n      id\\n      title\\n      content\\n    }\\n  }\\n  allPosts {\\n    id\\n    title\\n    content\\n    author {\\n      id\\n      name\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the schema defines User and Post types, their fields, and the relationships between them. The Query type includes operations for fetching users and posts, and the Mutation type includes operations for creating users and posts. The query fetches a specific user and their posts, as well as all posts and their authors.\\n\\nFor a deeper dive into GraphQL schemas and types, you can explore [this resource](/graphql/schemas-and-types/).\\n\\n#### OpenAPI: Schema Validation\\n\\nOpenAPI\'s use of JSON/YAML Schema for validation is more powerful than it might initially appear. Let\'s break this down with an example. Suppose you\'re building an e-commerce API. You could define a product schema like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\ncomponents:\\n  schemas:\\n    Product:\\n      type: object\\n      required:\\n        - id\\n        - name\\n        - price\\n      properties:\\n        id:\\n          type: integer\\n        name:\\n          type: string\\n          minLength: 1\\n          maxLength: 100\\n        price:\\n          type: number\\n          minimum: 0\\n        description:\\n          type: string\\n        categories:\\n          type: array\\n          items:\\n            type: string\\n```\\n\\nThis schema does more than just define the structure. It enforces business rules:\\n\\n- Products must have an id, name, and price (required fields)\\n\\n- Product names must be between 1 and 100 characters\\n\\n- Prices can\'t be negative\\n\\nBy defining these constraints in the OpenAPI spec, you\'re not just documenting your API - you\'re creating a contract that can be enforced by API gateways, automatically validated in tests, and used to generate accurate client SDKs. This level of detail at the design stage catches errors early, improves API consistency, and significantly reduces the likelihood of bugs in production.\\n\\n### C. Schema Definition\\n\\n#### GraphQL SDL vs OpenAPI Swagger\\n\\nGraphQL and OpenAPI use different approaches to define and document their APIs.\\n\\n**GraphQL: Schema Definition Language (SDL)**\\n\\nGraphQL uses the Schema Definition Language (SDL) to define the types and relationships within an API. SDL is a human-readable language that allows developers to describe the data structures and operations available on the GraphQL server. This schema acts as a contract between the client and server, ensuring that all queries and mutations adhere to the defined types and structures.\\n\\n**Example of GraphQL SDL:**\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype User {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  posts: [Post]\\n}\\n\\ntype Post {\\n  id: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  content: String!\\n  author: User\\n}\\n\\ntype Query {\\n  user(id: ID!): User\\n  allUsers: [User]\\n  post(id: ID!): Post\\n  allPosts: [Post]\\n}\\n\\ntype Mutation {\\n  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User\\n  createPost(\\n    title: String!\\n    content: String!\\n    authorId: ID!\\n  ): Post\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the schema defines `User` and `Post` types, their fields, and the relationships between them. It also defines queries to fetch users and posts, and mutations to create new users and posts.\\n\\n**OpenAPI: Swagger**\\n\\nOpenAPI uses JSON or YAML to describe endpoints, parameters, and responses. This specification format allows for detailed documentation of RESTful APIs, including request and response formats, authentication methods, and error handling. OpenAPI specifications can be used to generate API documentation, client SDKs, and server stubs, making it a comprehensive tool for API development.\\n\\n**Example of OpenAPI Swagger (YAML format):**\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenapi: 3.0.0\\ninfo:\\n  title: Example API\\n  version: 1.0.0\\npaths:\\n  /users:\\n    get:\\n      summary: Get a list of users\\n      responses:\\n        \\"200\\":\\n          description: A list of users\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                type: array\\n                items:\\n                  $ref: \\"#/components/schemas/User\\"\\n  /users/{id}:\\n    get:\\n      summary: Get a user by ID\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: id\\n          in: path\\n          required: true\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n      responses:\\n        \\"200\\":\\n          description: A user object\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                $ref: \\"#/components/schemas/User\\"\\n  /posts:\\n    post:\\n      summary: Create a new post\\n      requestBody:\\n        required: true\\n        content:\\n          application/json:\\n            schema:\\n              $ref: \\"#/components/schemas/Post\\"\\n      responses:\\n        \\"201\\":\\n          description: The created post\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                $ref: \\"#/components/schemas/Post\\"\\ncomponents:\\n  schemas:\\n    User:\\n      type: object\\n      properties:\\n        id:\\n          type: string\\n        name:\\n          type: string\\n        email:\\n          type: string\\n    Post:\\n      type: object\\n      properties:\\n        id:\\n          type: string\\n        title:\\n          type: string\\n        content:\\n          type: string\\n        authorId:\\n          type: string\\n```\\n\\nIn this OpenAPI example, the specification defines paths for fetching users and creating posts, along with the necessary parameters and responses. It also defines the `User` and `Post` schemas used in the API.\\n\\nBy using these tools, both GraphQL and OpenAPI provide clear, structured ways to define and document APIs, each with their own strengths and use cases.\\n\\n### D. API Documentation\\n\\n#### GraphQL: Self-Documenting\\n\\nGraphQL schemas are inherently self-documenting, allowing clients to introspect the schema and understand available operations. Tools like GraphiQL provide an interactive environment where developers can explore the schema, view available types and fields, and see the relationships between different data entities. This self-documenting feature of GraphQL significantly enhances the developer experience by providing built-in API documentation.\\n\\n**Example: GraphiQL Interface**\\n\\nTo demonstrate, let\'s use the Star Wars API (SWAPI) GraphiQL endpoint [here](https://graphql.github.io/swapi-graphql/). By navigating to the SWAPI GraphQL interface, you can interact with the API and see how the schema is documented.\\n\\nExample Query:\\n\\n```graphql\\n{\\n  allFilms {\\n    films {\\n      title\\n      director\\n      releaseDate\\n    }\\n  }\\n  allPeople {\\n    people {\\n      name\\n      birthYear\\n      homeworld {\\n        name\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis query fetches details about films and characters from the Star Wars universe. The GraphiQL interface allows you to see the available types, queries, and fields in the documentation tab.\\n\\nGraphiQL Documentation Snapshot:\\n\\nIn this snapshot of the GraphiQL interface, you can see the documentation tab open, displaying the schema with types and fields such as Film and Person, with fields like title, director, releaseDate, name, birthYear, and homeworld. This clean and professional interface reflects the self-documenting nature of GraphQL schemas, making it easy for developers to understand and use the API effectively.\\n\\nBy using the introspection capabilities of GraphQL and tools like GraphiQL, developers can quickly get up to speed with the API and explore its capabilities interactively.\\n\\n![snapshot-graphiql](/images/blog/snapshot-graphiql.png)\\n\\n#### OpenAPI: Manual and Auto-Generated Options\\n\\nOpenAPI supports both manual and auto-generated documentation, which enhances the ease of sharing API details. Tools like Swagger UI allow developers to create interactive API documentation that can be explored and tested directly from the browser. This makes it easier for both developers and non-developers to understand and interact with the API.\\n\\n**Example: Spotify API Documentation**\\n\\nSpotify uses OpenAPI to provide comprehensive and interactive API documentation. Their public-facing documentation, which can be accessed [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), showcases the power of auto-generated documentation. With detailed descriptions of endpoints, parameters, and response formats, along with interactive features to test the API, Spotify\'s documentation serves as an excellent example of how OpenAPI can streamline the process of API development and consumption.\\n\\n**Swagger UI Example:**\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenapi: 3.0.0\\ninfo:\\n  title: Spotify API\\n  version: 1.0.0\\npaths:\\n  /tracks/{id}:\\n    get:\\n      summary: Get a track\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: id\\n          in: path\\n          required: true\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n      responses:\\n        \\"200\\":\\n          description: A track object\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                $ref: \\"#/components/schemas/Track\\"\\ncomponents:\\n  schemas:\\n    Track:\\n      type: object\\n      properties:\\n        id:\\n          type: string\\n        name:\\n          type: string\\n        artist:\\n          type: string\\n        album:\\n          type: string\\n```\\n\\nWith Swagger UI, this specification can be rendered into a fully interactive API documentation interface, where users can explore different endpoints, see example requests and responses, and even try out API calls directly from the documentation page. This approach not only improves the developer experience but also helps in maintaining up-to-date and accessible API documentation.\\n\\nBelow, we have a snapshot of the Spotify OpenAPI documentation:\\n\\n![spotify-swagger](/images/blog/snapshot-spotifyOpenAPI.png)\\n\\n#### OpenAPI: Manual and Auto-Generated Options\\n\\nOpenAPI supports both manual and auto-generated documentation through tools like Swagger UI, making it easier to share API details.\\n\\n### E.

Follow us as we discuss real world scenarios and perform a detailed feature-comparison on both, concluding exactly where each should be used.\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nLet\u2019s say you are building a social app like Reddit, and you have screens like home and popular. You implement a simple REST API on the backend and everything looks fine:\\n\\n- it wasn\u2019t so challenging to setup\\n- has tons of resources if anything goes wrong\\n- seems like a perfect solution.\\n\\nUntil the user base grows and there\u2019s thousands of users - and disaster strikes: the loading times increase and the costs skyrocket, you begin to lose engagement of the users.\\n\\nDeep down, the root cause of this problem is the slow nature of REST and over-fetching. What happens is that when a user opens the app, goes to the home screen, and the app fetches tons of unnecessary data from the backend: all pictures of a post, all comments and even related posts! Which is even worsened by the fact that the client has to call multiple endpoints to finally show the feed to the user. You are stuck in performance jargon, let\u2019s rewind it. You use graphQL instead of REST, which has many advantages over the REST:\\n\\n- thanks to its predefined schemas you don\u2019t have to spend hours writing simple validation tests to check that a parameter is a number and not a string.\\n- graphQL only serves what the client asks for, which means there\u2019s no chance of over-fetching\\n- not to mention that one endpoint of graphQL is more useful and comprehensive than 5 REST API routes.\\n\\n## Knowing gRPC\\n\\nSo what is behind the magic of gRPC ? Since Google open-sourced it in 2015, gRPC has been revolutionizing service-to-service communication with its robust, schema-driven framework. By harnessing the power of HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), gRPC unleashes high-performance, real-time data streaming and rock-solid typing - a winning combo that\'s made it a go-to tool for developers building scalable, efficient systems. No wonder tech titans like [Tesla, Netflix, Coinbase and Dropbox](https://theirstack.com/en/technology/grpc) are all on board!\\n\\nRead more about [What is gRPC](/blog/what-is-grpc/).\\n\\n![companies using grpc](/images/docs/stack-grpc.png)\\n\\n## Unleashing GraphQL Magic!\\n\\nGraphQL, born at Facebook in 2012 and unleashed to the world in 2015, revolutionizes API queries. It\u2019s a powerful and flexible alternative to REST APIs, featuring declarative data fetching that ensures you get just the data you need\u2014no more, no less. With a single endpoint, GraphQL simplifies API structures, eliminating the hassle of managing multiple endpoints. This efficiency and flexibility have made it the darling of tech giants like [Github, Meta, Shopify and Microsoft ](https://landscape.graphql.org/borderless-mode?grouping=category). With GraphQL, you can build more efficient and intuitive APIs that make data fetching a breeze!\\n\\nRead more about [What is GraphQL and How it works?](/graphql/what-is-graphql).\\n\\n![companies using graphql](/images/docs/stack-graphql.png)\\n\\n## Feature Comparison\\n\\n| Feature                           | gRPC                                                    | GraphQL                                                                                        |\\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| **Message Format**                | Binary                                                  | JSON                                                                                           |\\n| **Data Fetching**                 | Fixed endpoints and methods                             | Flexible queries, specified by clients                                                         |\\n| **Real-Time**                     | Supports streaming via server-side push                 | Supports real-time updates via subscriptions                                                   |\\n| **Type Safety**                   | Strongly typed with Protocol Buffers                    | Strongly typed with schema definition                                                          |\\n| **Introspection**                 | No built-in introspection                               | Built-in schema introspection                                                                  |\\n| **Code Generation**               | Automatic code generation from .proto files             | Code generation tools available, but not automatic                                             |\\n| **Tooling and Browser Support**   | Limited browser support, requires proxies for web use   | Strong tooling support, works natively in browsers                                             |\\n| **Community**                     | currently nascent                                       | Growing rapidly, strong in web and mobile development                                          |\\n| **Adoption**                      | widely in microservices                                 | mostly in mobile app development and [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)s |\\n| **Performance**                   | High performance with low latency                       | Generally efficient, schemas defined correctly                                                 |\\n| **Debugging and Troubleshooting** | non-human-readable format, require tools for debugging. | JSON response is easier to read and debug                                                      |\\n\\n## Scenarios for Using gRPC\\n\\nThe ideal scenario for gRPC? When microservices need to communicate at lightning speed and with top-notch efficiency! Think of gRPC as the ultimate express lane for data\u2014perfect when you need swift, reliable interactions and don\u2019t need to be super flexible. It\u2019s like having a fast track for your information, keeping everything running smoothly and quickly!\\n\\n### Scenario 1: A social media app backend\\n\\n![sm app example](/images/docs/services.png)\\n\\nImagine a social media app where everything works like clockwork. Here\u2019s how gRPC fits in:\\nThe Cast:\\n\\n- Media-Scanner: Analyzes media files with precision.\\n- Media-Tagger: Tags content accurately.\\n- Jobs-Manager: Handles tasks efficiently.\\n- Followers-Notifier: Sends timely updates to users.\\n\\nIn this setup, gRPC\u2019s Protocol Buffers ensure fast, efficient communication, cutting down on overhead and latency. Each service gets exactly what it needs, there\'s no risk of overfetching. It\u2019s a perfect match for microservices, where speed and efficiency are key.\\n\\n### Scenario 2: A movie streaming backend\\n\\n![movie app example](/images/docs/services2.png)\\n\\nImagine the backend of a movie-streaming app, where Content-Age-Rater, Relations-Builder, Subtitles-Generator, and Subtitles-Translator each have their own star roles. They rate movies, connect related content, create subtitles, and translate them with precision. With gRPC, these services chat efficiently, making sure data zips around quickly and smoothly. No extra baggage\u2014just a slick, high-performance team working seamlessly together. It\u2019s like having a top-notch crew behind the scenes, making sure everything runs smooth! \ud83c\udfac\ud83c\udf7f\\n\\n## Scenarios for Using GraphQL\\n\\nGraphQL shines when you need to tailor data fetching to match your frontend\'s needs precisely. It allows for fetching exactly the data you need, nothing more, nothing less, which can be a game-changer for optimizing performance and reducing over-fetching. This flexibility can really streamline interactions between the frontend and backend, especially in complex applications, as we discuss below:\\n\\n### Scenario 1: Fetching Multiple Items\\n\\nGitHub uses GraphQL to make fetching PR details a breeze. With gRPC, you\'d have to set up different RPC methods for each data type\u2014comments, commits, changed files\u2014potentially resulting in several requests. Often, you just need the first and last comments right off the bat. GraphQL swoops in, pulling exactly those details with one neat query, cutting down on network strain and speeding things up.\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  repository(owner: \\"username\\", name: \\"repository-name\\") {\\n    pullRequest(number: 123) {\\n      title\\n      createdAt\\n      updatedAt\\n      author {\\n        login\\n        avatarUrl\\n      }\\n      comments(first: 2, orderBy: {field: CREATED_AT, direction: ASC}) {\\n        nodes {\\n          author {\\n            login\\n          }\\n          body\\n          createdAt\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nInstagram uses a smart approach to fetch just a handful of comments on a reel\u2014those that show up right under the title without diving into the full comments section. It\u2019d be a hassle to pull 10 or 20 comments when only 5 are needed. This is where GraphQL shines, perfectly tuned for getting just the right data without any extra fluff.\\n\\n### Scenario 2: Ecommerce App\\n\\n![graphql fetch](/images/docs/fetch-graphql.png)\\n\\nThink about an ecommerce app with loads of products. On the explore page, users just want a quick snapshot\u2014picture, name, and a brief description. But when they dive into a product page, they\u2019re looking for more details like weight and extra images. With gRPC, you\u2019d need separate calls for each view, which can be a bit clunky and might pull in extra data. GraphQL, on the other hand, lets you customize your queries to get just what you need for each page, cutting down on excess data and making everything run smoother:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  products {\\n    id\\n    name\\n    shortDescription\\n    imageUrl\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor the product details page:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  product(id: \\"product-id\\") {\\n    id\\n    name\\n    description\\n    weight\\n    images {\\n      url\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis approach makes data retrieval a breeze and keeps performance top-notch, highlighting why GraphQL shines in dynamic content and ecommerce apps over gRPC. It\u2019s all about getting exactly what you need, when you need it, and keeping things running smoothly!\\n\\n## Integrating gRPC and GraphQL\\n\\n![integrating both](/images/docs/integration.png)\\n\\nPicture a social media app where the backend whips up user feeds based on activity. The frontend needs different data for various screens\u2014blogs or videos\u2014so grabbing everything at once would be overkill. GraphQL steps in to save the day by letting the frontend fetch just what it needs, keeping things snappy and efficient.\\n\\nMeanwhile, backend services like feed-generator and logs-handler are busy creating and analyzing feeds. They require steady input and don\u2019t need much tweaking once live. For this, gRPC is perfect with its lightning-fast performance and low latency.\\n\\nBy mixing GraphQL on the frontend with gRPC on the backend, you get a dynamic, high-performance setup. GraphQL fine-tunes data requests while gRPC keeps backend communication smooth.\\n\\nRead this guide explaining the challenges and details associated with integrating gRPC and graphQL: [Building GraphQL over gRPC](/docs/graphql-grpc-tailcall) .\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn summary, both gRPC and graphQL have numerous advantages over each other, where gRPC has:\\n\\n- more boosted performance\\n- Low payload sizes\\n- Simple and intuitive API design\\n\\nOn the other hand GraphQL takes the lead in:\\n\\n- API flexibility\\n- Friendly nature for web and mobile apps\\n- Easier debugging\\n\\nIt doesn\u2019t matter which one is better, what truly matters is how good it is implemented, and how well it suits the use case.

For more information, see [Customization](https://graphiql-test.netlify.app/typedoc/modules/graphiql.html#customize).\\n\\n## Accessing GraphiQL\\n\\nYou can access GraphiQL using either of these methods:\\n\\n### Directly through Tailcall Playground\\n\\nIf you have a running GraphQL server and want to interact with it graphically, use [Tailcall Playground](https://tailcall.run/playground/). Open the playground and enter the root endpoint of your server:\\n\\n![screenshot showing docs loading and endpoint entered](/images/graphiql/docs.png)\\n\\n**Note:** Ensure your server\'s CORS policy allows requests from the Tailcall domain.\\n\\nOnce you enter the endpoint, the schema is automatically loaded, and you are good to go.\\n\\n### By Starting the GraphQL Server with Tailcall\\n\\nOr, if you use Tailcall for your GraphQL server, the playground URL is provided once you [start the server](https://tailcall.run/docs/#starting-the-graphql-server):\\n\\n![screenshot showing the output in console](/images/graphiql/logoutput.png)\\n\\nSimply click on the link, and it will open the Tailcall Playground with the endpoint already set up.\\n\\n## Exploring the GraphiQL Interface\\n\\n### Query Editor\\n\\nPacked with handy features like autocomplete, syntax highlighting, error detection, and code folding, this editor keeps your code neat and saves you tons of time.\\n\\n### Variables Editor\\n\\nEasily edit variables with autocomplete based on the ones declared in your query\u2014no more tedious copy-pasting of long variable names in complex queries.\\n\\n![vars screenshot](/images/graphiql/vars.png)\\n\\n### Response Pane\\n\\nCheck out the server\'s response here. It\'s super useful for handling lots of nested data, with built-in folding to keep things tidy and avoid getting lost in a sea of JSON.\\n\\n![response pane](/images/graphiql/response.png)\\n\\n## Setting Headers\\n\\n1. Access the Headers Panel right beside the variables panel at the bottom\\n\\n![headers screenshot](/images/graphiql/header.png)\\n\\n2. Add Custom Headers\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"Authorization\\": \\"token myghtoken\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n3. Run Your Query!\\n\\n## Alternatives\\n\\nIn case GraphiQL doesn\u2019t quite work out for you and you want to try another IDE, here are some options:\\n\\nIntrospection with Postman\\n![introspection with postman](/images/graphiql/postman2.png)\\n\\nQuerying with Postman\\n\\n![querying with postman](/images/graphiql/postman1.png)\\n\\n- **[Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-overview/)**\\n- **[Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/graphql-queries)**\\n- **[Altair Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/)**\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWrapping up, we discussed how GraphiQL is an absolute life-saver, especially when you have a server with hundreds of queries returning hundreds of fields of response data. It also makes it super easy to set up a GraphQL playground, like the Tailcall Playground.\\nIt\u2019s relieving and exciting to see new open-source projects being launched that make our lives as programmers much easier:\\n\\n- Tailcall absolutely boosts server speed and performance\\n- GraphiQL is a total blessing for testing servers in the development stage\\n- Voyager is the ultimate tool to graphically view and edit your complex schemas.\\n\\nHappy coding, and may your queries always be clean and your responses always be quick, see you in the next one! \ud83d\ude80"},{"id":"graphql-schema-part-2-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-3","source":"@site/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-3-2024-07-23.mdx","title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 4","description":"Learn how to remove schema elements without causing disruptions.

Now, we\'ll tackle the most challenging part: removing schema elements and handling breaking changes.\\n\\n## Recap of Additive Changes and Modifications\\n\\nIn [Part 2](/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-1), we focused on additive changes, emphasizing the importance of expanding your schema\'s capabilities without disrupting existing clients. By adding new fields, types, and arguments, you can enhance your API while maintaining backward compatibility.\\n\\nIn [Part 3](/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-2), we delved into modifying existing schema elements, discussing how to handle changes such as updating default values, transforming non-null fields to nullable, and changing field types. We highlighted the need for clear communication, providing transition paths, and leveraging schema design tools to minimize client disruptions.\\n\\n### Safe, Dangerous, and Breaking Changes\\n\\n1. **Safe Changes:** Additive changes such as adding new fields or types that do not affect existing queries or functionality.\\n2. **Dangerous Changes:** Modifications that might not break the schema immediately but can cause subtle issues, such as changing default values or making non-nullable fields nullable.\\n3. **Breaking Changes:** Changes that will definitely break existing queries and require clients to update their code, such as removing fields or changing field types.\\n\\n## The Subtraction Subterfuge\\n\\nRemoving things from your schema is almost always a breaking change. If you remove a field, type, or argument, clients that depend on it will break. You can\'t just take things away without consequences.\\n\\nBut sometimes, it\'s necessary. Here\'s how to do it without causing a riot.\\n\\n### The Field Farewell\\n\\nLet\'s say we want to remove a field because it\'s causing performance issues. Here\'s the smart way to do it:\\n\\n1. Introduce a replacement\\n2. Deprecate the old field\\n3. Wait (patiently!)\\n4. Remove when usage has died down\\n\\n```diff\\ntype Query {\\n-  products(first: Int!): [Product!]!\\n+  products(first: Int!): [Product!]! @deprecated(reason: \u201cproducts is deprecated and is getting replaced by the field `topProducts`.\u201d)\\n+  topProducts(first: Int!): [Product!]!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy introducing `topProducts` and deprecating `products`, we give our clients time to adapt. And hey, we\'ve even improved our API in the process!\\n\\nThe old field may be removed after a certain period and if the usage for it has gone down. Keep in mind you don\u2019t necessarily have to make the change unless absolutely needed. Additive changes and deprecations are sometimes enough to keep evolving the API.\\n\\n### The Argument Abandonment\\n\\nRemoving an argument is similar to removing a field. You can deprecate it and\\n\\nintroduce a new field with the desired behavior. Clients will have time to migrate to the new field before the old one is removed.\\n\\n```diff\\ntype Query {\\n-  products(first: Int!, featured: Boolean): String!\\n+  products(first: Int!, featured: Boolean): String! @deprecated(reason: \u201cproducts is deprecated, use `allProducts` for products and `featuredProducts` to get products that are featured\u201d)\\n+  allProducts(first: Int!): String!\\n+  featuredProducts(first: Int!): String!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you need to make a change to an existing field, because arguments can\u2019t be deprecated just yet, you should indicate that the argument is deprecated through its description.\\n\\n```diff\\ntype Query {\\n- products(first: Int!, featured: Boolean): String!\\n+  products(first: Int!,\\n+  # DEPRECATED: This argument will be removed. Use query `featuredProducts`.\\n+  featured: Boolean\\n+   ): String!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### The Type Deletion Dilemma\\n\\nSometimes, you need to remove an entire type from your schema. This is a major operation and requires careful planning.\\n\\n1. First, deprecate all fields that return this type:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  oldUser(id: ID!): OldUser @deprecated(reason: \\"Use `user` query with new User type instead\\")\\n  user(id: ID!): User\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. If the type is part of a union or implements an interface, you\'ll need to be extra cautious. These can\'t be easily deprecated, so clear communication is key.\\n3. Finally, after a long deprecation period and when usage has dropped to zero, you can remove the type entirely.\\n\\nNote that you might want to deprecate using that type within your codebase to avoid developers to use that User type for new fields. Removing a type is even trickier when it\u2019s part of union types or implements interfaces. Once again, union members and interface implementations cannot be marked as deprecated. This means that fields like node may stop working correctly if the type you\u2019re removing was reachable through that field.\\n\\nYour best bet in these cases are to either keep this type as part of unions and through interfaces or to communicate that change very carefully through descriptions and out of band communication like documentation and emails.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nRemoving schema elements is a delicate process that requires strategic planning and clear communication to avoid breaking changes. By following the principles and strategies outlined in this article, you can confidently remove fields, arguments, and types while minimizing disruption to your clients.\\n\\nRemember these key takeaways:\\n\\n1. **Deprecate Cautiously**: Use deprecation notices, schema descriptions, and out-of-band communication to keep your clients informed about upcoming changes.\\n2. **Provide Transition Paths**: When breaking changes are necessary, offer clear migration paths. This might involve introducing new fields alongside deprecated ones or providing new query structures that achieve the same results.\\n3. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on usage metrics to determine when it\'s safe to remove deprecated elements. Don\'t rush the process \u2013 give your clients time to adapt.\\n   :::note\\n   Tailcall supports a variety of integrations with monitoring tools to help you track usage metrics and make informed decisions about schema changes. you can check out our [documentation](/docs/graphql-data-dog-telemetry-tailcall/) for more information.\\n   :::\\n\\nBy treating your GraphQL schema as a product with its own lifecycle and evolution strategy, you can build APIs that are both powerful and adaptable. This approach allows you to innovate rapidly while providing a stable and reliable service to your clients.\\n\\nRemember, a great GraphQL schema is never truly finished \u2013 it\'s a living, breathing entity that grows and evolves with your application\'s needs. Embrace this continuous evolution, and you\'ll create APIs that stand the test of time."},{"id":"graphql-schema-part-2-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-2","source":"@site/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-2-2024-07-22.mdx","title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 3","description":"Learn how to modify existing schema elements in GraphQL without causing disruptions.","date":"2024-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"GraphQL","permalink":"/blog/tags/graph-ql"},{"inline":true,"label":"API","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"inline":true,"label":"Schema","permalink":"/blog/tags/schema"},{"inline":true,"label":"Design","permalink":"/blog/tags/design"},{"inline":true,"label":"Best Practices","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practices"}],"readingTime":4.625,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 3","authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"tags":["GraphQL","API","Schema","Design","Best Practices"],"description":"Learn how to modify existing schema elements in GraphQL without causing disruptions.","image":"/images/graphql/graphql-schema-structure.png","hide_table_of_contents":true,"slug":"graphql-schema-part-2-2"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 4","permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 2","permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-1"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nimport Quiz from \\"../src/components/quiz/quiz.tsx\\"\\n\\n## What Do You Already Know? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcab\\n\\n<Quiz\\n  title=\\"GraphQL Schema Change\\"\\n  questions={[\\n    {\\n      id: 1,\\n      text: \\"Changing the default value of an argument is considered a:\\",\\n      options: [\\"Safe change\\", \\"Dangerous change\\", \\"Breaking change\\", \\"Non-issue\\"],\\n      correctAnswer: 1,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 2,\\n      text: \\"When changing a field type from non-nullable to nullable, what should be considered to prevent client-side errors?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"Updating the field\'s description\\",\\n        \\"Implementing a fallback value in resolvers\\",\\n        \\"Notifying clients via email\\",\\n        \\"Adding a deprecation notice\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 1,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 3,\\n      text: \\"Which of the following changes is likely to cause the most disruption?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"Changing a field\'s default value\\",\\n        \\"Deprecating a field\\",\\n        \\"Changing a field\'s type from String to ID\\",\\n        \\"Adding a new optional argument\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 2,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 4,\\n      text: \\"Modifying an existing field to be non-null is generally considered a:\\",\\n      options: [\\"Safe change\\", \\"Dangerous change\\", \\"Breaking change\\", \\"Improvement\\"],\\n      correctAnswer: 2,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 5,\\n      text: \\"When changing a field\'s return type, what is the best approach to minimize client impact?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"Immediately update the schema\\",\\n        \\"Provide a new field with the updated type and deprecate the old one\\",\\n        \\"Change the field type and notify clients afterward\\",\\n        \\"Modify the resolver logic to handle both types\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 1,\\n    },\\n  ]}\\n/>\\n\\n## Modifying Without Breaking: Navigating the Modification Minefield\\n\\nIn our [previous post](/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-1), we explored how to make additive changes to your GraphQL schema without causing disruptions. Now, we\'ll dive into the tricky territory of modifying existing schema elements.\\n\\n## Recap of Additive Changes\\n\\nIn [Part 2](/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-1), we discussed the importance of making additive changes to your GraphQL schema to expand its capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility. By adding new fields, types, and arguments, you can enhance your API without causing disruptions to existing clients. We also emphasized the importance of providing transition paths to ensure a smooth adoption process.\\n\\n### Safe, Dangerous, and Breaking Changes\\n\\n1. **Safe Changes:** Additive changes such as adding new fields or types that do not affect existing queries or functionality.\\n2. **Dangerous Changes:** Modifications that might not break the schema immediately but can cause subtle issues, such as changing default values or making non-nullable fields nullable.\\n3. **Breaking Changes:** Changes that will definitely break existing queries and require clients to update their code, such as removing fields or changing field types.\\n\\n## The Modification Minefield\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about modifying existing parts of your schema. This is where things can get really hairy. For example, changing a field\u2019s type or changing the name of a type is a big-breaking change.\\n\\n### The Default Value Dilemma\\n\\nChanging default values might seem innocent, but it can cause some serious headaches. Consider this:\\n\\n```diff\\ntype Query {\\n-  products(category: String, showOutOfStock: Boolean = False): [Product!]!\\n+  products(category: String, showOutOfStock: Boolean = True): [Product!]!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nChanging the default value of an argument or input field is unlikely to be a breaking change in terms of the schema itself, but is very likely to cause issues at runtime if the default value affects the runtime behavior of the field.\\n\\nAvoid this change in general, but it may be possible to achieve if the behavior of the field does not change.\\n\\n### The Non-Null to Null Transformation\\n\\nThis is one of the trickiest changes to make. You thought making a field non-null was a good idea, but now you need to change it back. Here\'s how to handle it:\\n\\nFor scalar fields, you might be able to save your users from errors by returning the `default value` instead of null.\\n\\nFor object types, sometimes it\u2019s possible to use a `Default Object` when the result is null.\\n\\nThis approach can help prevent null pointer exceptions on the client side.\\n\\n### Changing a Field Type\\n\\nChanging a field\u2019s type is not a change we can make easily. Once again, approaching the change in an additive is often your best bet.\\n\\n```diff\\ntype User {\\n  bestFriend: String! @deprecated(reason: \u201cUse `bestFriendObject` instead.\u201d)\\n+ bestFriendObject: User!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you might have noticed, the downside of additive changes is that often the best names are already taken. If wanted, you may remove the original field and reintroduce it under the new object at that point.\\n\\n```diff\\ntype User {\\n- bestFriend: String! @deprecated(reason: \u201cUse `bestFriendObject` instead.\u201d)\\n  bestFriendObject: User!\\n+ bestFriend: User!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Changing Description or Deprecation\\n\\nChanging the description of fields, types and any member is unlikely to cause any harm to clients. Clients should not depend on schema descriptions for runtime logic!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nModifying existing schema elements requires careful planning and execution to avoid breaking changes. By following the principles and strategies outlined in this article, you can confidently make necessary modifications while minimizing disruption to your clients.\\n\\nRemember these key takeaways:\\n\\n1. **Deprecate Cautiously**: Use deprecation notices, schema descriptions, and out-of-band communication to keep your clients informed about upcoming changes.\\n2. **Provide Transition Paths**: When breaking changes are necessary, offer clear migration paths. This might involve introducing new fields alongside deprecated ones or providing new query structures that achieve the same results.\\n3. **Leverage Schema Design Tools**: Use schema comparison tools like [GraphQL Editor](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-editor).\\n\\nBy treating your GraphQL schema as a product with its own lifecycle and evolution strategy, you can build APIs that are both powerful and adaptable. This approach allows you to innovate rapidly while providing a stable and reliable service to your clients.\\n\\nStay tuned for the [next part](/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-3) of this series, where we will dive into removing schema elements and handling breaking changes!"},{"id":"graphql-schema-part-2-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-1","source":"@site/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-1-2024-07-21.mdx","title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 2","description":"Learn how to make additive changes to your GraphQL schema without causing disruptions.","date":"2024-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"GraphQL","permalink":"/blog/tags/graph-ql"},{"inline":true,"label":"API","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"inline":true,"label":"Schema","permalink":"/blog/tags/schema"},{"inline":true,"label":"Design","permalink":"/blog/tags/design"},{"inline":true,"label":"Best Practices","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practices"}],"readingTime":8.15,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 2","authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"tags":["GraphQL","API","Schema","Design","Best Practices"],"description":"Learn how to make additive changes to your GraphQL schema without causing disruptions.","image":"/images/graphql/graphql-schema-structure.png","hide_table_of_contents":true,"slug":"graphql-schema-part-2-1"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 3","permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Apollo vs Urql vs Fetch: The Ultimate Showdown","permalink":"/blog/graphql-angular-client"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nimport Quiz from \\"../src/components/quiz/quiz.tsx\\"\\n\\n## What Do You Already Know? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcab\\n\\n<Quiz\\n  title=\\"GraphQL Schema Change\\"\\n  questions={[\\n    {\\n      id: 1,\\n      text: \\"Adding a new field to a GraphQL schema is generally a:\\",\\n      options: [\\"Safe change\\", \\"Dangerous change\\", \\"Breaking change\\", \\"Requires deprecation\\"],\\n      correctAnswer: 0,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 2,\\n      text: \\"What is a potential issue when adding a new optional argument to a resolver?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"It requires clients to update their queries\\",\\n        \\"It can change the default behavior if not handled properly\\",\\n        \\"It always breaks existing queries\\",\\n        \\"It is not allowed in GraphQL\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 1,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 3,\\n      text: \\"Which strategy can make adding a required argument safe?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"Introducing a new field\\",\\n        \\"Providing a default value\\",\\n        \\"Deprecating the old argument\\",\\n        \\"Using introspection queries\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 1,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 4,\\n      text: \\"What is a common risk when adding a new type to an existing interface?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"Clients will receive runtime errors if not properly type-checked\\",\\n        \\"The schema becomes invalid\\",\\n        \\"Existing types get overridden\\",\\n        \\"It forces all clients to update immediately\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 0,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      id: 5,\\n      text: \\"What should clients implement to handle new union members?\\",\\n      options: [\\n        \\"Fallback UI components for unknown types\\",\\n        \\"Always use non-null fields\\",\\n        \\"Deprecation notices\\",\\n        \\"Schema descriptions\\",\\n      ],\\n      correctAnswer: 0,\\n    },\\n  ]}\\n/>\\n\\nIn our [previous post](/blog/graphql-schema), we learned scalable GraphQL schema is critical for building production-ready APIs that can evolve with your application\'s needs.\\n\\nIn this post, we will dive deeper into how to **continuously** evolve your schema to meet your application\'s changing requirements without hard-coded versioning.\\n\\n## Adding Without Breaking: The Art of Additive Changes\\n\\nYou know that feeling when you\'re working on a project, and suddenly you realize your schema needs to change? Maybe you need to add a new field, modify an existing one, or even remove something entirely. It\'s enough to make any developer break out in a cold sweat, right?\\n\\nBut fear not! I\'m here to show you **how to evolve your schema like a pro**, keeping your API fresh and exciting without causing your clients to tear their hair out.\\n\\n## The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Schema Changes\\n\\nNot all changes are created equal. In this section, we\u2019ll analyze a few different types of changes and what makes them safe or unsafe.\\n\\nFirst things first, let\'s break down the types of changes we might make to our schema:\\n\\n1. **Safe Changes:** These are the golden children of schema evolution. You can make these changes anytime, and your clients won\'t even bat an eyelash.\\n2. **Dangerous Changes:** These are the sneaky ones. They might not break anything outright, but they can cause subtle issues that\'ll have your clients scratching their heads. We\'ll need to proceed carefully here.\\n3. **Breaking Changes:** The name says it all. These changes will send your clients\' applications crashing down faster than you can say \\"**GraphQL**\\". We want to avoid these like the plague, but sometimes they\'re necessary. Don\'t worry, I\'ll show you how to handle them like a pro.\\n\\n## Additive Changes\\n\\nMost of the time, these are safe as houses.\\n\\nFor example, adding fields & adding types is unlikely to cause issues for clients. But, there are a few tricky scenarios to watch out for.\\n\\n### The Optional Argument Conundrum\\n\\nAdding optional arguments is generally safe - it\'s like offering your clients a shiny new toy without forcing them to play with it.\\n\\nHowever, there\'s a catch. Check this out:\\n\\n```diff\\n  type Query {\\n-   products(category: String): [Product!]!\\n+   products(category: String, inStock: Boolean): [Product!]!\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nSee what we did there? We added an optional `inStock` argument. Seems harmless, right?\\n\\nLet\'s dive deeper into why changing the behavior of a resolver when an optional argument isn\'t provided can be problematic:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  products(category: String, inStock: Boolean): [Product!]!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nImagine you have clients that have been using this query:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  products(category: \\"Electronics\\") {\\n    name\\n    price\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf your resolver suddenly starts filtering out out-of-stock products when `inStock` isn\'t provided, these clients will unexpectedly receive fewer results. This could break their UI or data processing logic.\\n\\nTo avoid this issue, you can implement a strategy to handle the absence of the `inStock` argument gracefully in your resolver, so that the behavior remains consistent for clients.\\n\\n### The Required Argument Trap\\n\\nNow, this is where things get spicy \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f.\\n\\nAdding a required argument is almost always a **breaking change**.\\n\\nBut, fear not! There\'s a way out:\\n\\n```diff\\n  type Query {\\n-   products(category: String): [Product!]!\\n+   products(category: String, sortBy: SortOption!): [Product!]!\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nThis change is **breaking**, but it doesn\'t have to be.\\n\\nYou can provide a **default value** for the new argument to keep your existing clients happy.\\n\\n```diff\\ntype Query {\\n-    products(category: String): [Product!]!\\n+    products(category: String, sortBy: SortOption! = POPULARITY): [Product!]!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSee that `= POPULARITY`? That\'s your get-out-of-jail-free card. By providing a default value, you\'ve made this addition safe.\\n\\nExisting clients will use the default, and new clients can take advantage of the sorting option.\\n\\n### The Interface and Union Twist\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about some trickier additive changes that can catch you off guard if you\'re not careful.\\n\\n### Adding New Interface Implementations\\n\\nAdding a new type that implements an existing interface might seem harmless, but it can cause some unexpected behavior. Check this out:\\n\\n```graphql\\ninterface Node {\\n  id: ID!\\n}\\n\\ntype User implements Node {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype Team implements Node {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n}\\n\\n# highlight-start\\ntype Organization implements Node {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  employees: [User!]!\\n}\\n# highlight-end\\n```\\n\\nBy adding the `Organization` type, we\'ve expanded what could be returned by queries selecting for `Node`. This could break clients that aren\'t prepared to handle new types. Always encourage clients to use proper type checking.\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  node(id: \\"1\\") {\\n    ... on User {\\n      name\\n    }\\n    ... on Team {\\n      name\\n    }\\n    ... on Organization {\\n      name\\n      employees {\\n        name\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWithout proper type checking, clients might encounter these issues:\\n\\n1. **Runtime Errors:** If a client assumes all Node types have only a name field, they might try to access `employees` on a `User` or `Team`, causing errors.\\n2. **Missing Data:** Clients might not display Organization-specific data if they\'re not prepared to handle it.\\n3. **Incorrect Data Processing:** Business logic that assumes only `User` and `Team` types exist might produce incorrect results.\\n\\nTo mitigate these issues:\\n\\n1. Use TypeScript or Flow on the client-side to catch type errors at compile-time.\\n2. Implement exhaustive type checking in your client code:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction handleNode(node: Node) {\\n  switch (node.__typename) {\\n    case \\"User\\":\\n      return handleUser(node)\\n    case \\"Team\\":\\n      return handleTeam(node)\\n    case \\"Organization\\":\\n      return handleOrganization(node)\\n    default:\\n      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = node\\n      throw new Error(`Unhandled node type: ${(_exhaustiveCheck as any).__typename}`)\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis approach ensures that if a new type is added in the future, TypeScript will raise a compile-time error, prompting developers to update their code.\\n\\n### The Union Expansion Conundrum\\n\\nSimilar to interfaces, adding new members to a union can cause runtime surprises. Consider this:\\n\\n```diff\\n-  union SearchResult = User | Post\\n+  union SearchResult = User | Post | Comment\\n```\\n\\nSurprise! Your clients might suddenly receive a type they weren\'t expecting. It\'s like opening a box of chocolates and finding a pickle - not necessarily bad, but definitely unexpected. Make sure to document how clients should handle these surprise types.\\n\\nLet\'s delve into why union expansions can be tricky and how to handle them gracefully:\\n\\nWhen you add `Comment` to the `SearchResult` union, existing clients might break in subtle ways:\\n\\n1. **Incomplete UI:** If the client only has UI components for `User` and `Post`, `Comment` results won\'t be displayed.\\n2. **Runtime Errors:** Code that assumes only `User` and `Post` types exist might throw errors when encountering a `Comment`.\\n\\nTo handle this gracefully:\\n\\n1. Implement a fallback UI component for unknown types:\\n\\n   ```tsx\\n   function SearchResultItem({result}) {\\n     switch (result.__typename) {\\n       case \\"User\\":\\n         return <UserResult user={result} />\\n       case \\"Post\\":\\n         return <PostResult post={result} />\\n       case \\"Comment\\":\\n         return <CommentResult comment={result} />\\n       default:\\n         return <UnknownResultType type={result.__typename} />\\n     }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Encourage clients to use introspection queries to stay updated on schema changes:\\n\\n   ```graphql\\n   query {\\n     __type(name: \\"SearchResult\\") {\\n       kinds\\n       possibleTypes {\\n         name\\n       }\\n     }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\nBy implementing these strategies, clients can gracefully handle new union members without breaking existing functionality.\\n\\n### The Enum Evolution\\n\\nAdding new enum values seems innocent enough, but it can impact client-side logic. Let\'s look at an example:\\n\\n```diff\\n  enum OrderStatus {\\n   PENDING\\n   COMPLETED\\n+  CANCELED\\n+  REFUNDED\\n}\\n```\\n\\nClients that were using exhaustive switches might now have incomplete logic. Encourage clients to use default cases to handle new enum values.\\n\\n```typescript\\nswitch (order.status) {\\n  case \\"PENDING\\":\\n    return \\"Order is pending\\"\\n  case \\"COMPLETED\\":\\n    return \\"Order is completed\\"\\n  default:\\n    return \\"Order status unknown\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEvolving a GraphQL schema through additive changes allows you to expand your API\'s capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility. By following the principles and strategies outlined in this article, you can confidently add new fields, types, and arguments without causing disruptions to your clients.\\n\\nRemember these key takeaways:\\n\\n1. **Favor Additive Changes**: Whenever possible, add new fields, types, or arguments instead of modifying existing ones. This approach maintains backward compatibility while allowing your schema to grow.\\n\\n2. **Provide Transition Paths**: Introduce new features alongside existing ones to allow gradual client adoption.\\n\\nBy treating your GraphQL schema as a product with its own lifecycle and evolution strategy, you can build APIs that are both powerful and adaptable. This approach allows you to innovate rapidly while providing a stable and reliable service to your clients.\\n\\nStay tuned for the [next part](/blog/graphql-schema-part-2-2) of this series, where we will dive into removing schema elements and handling breaking changes!"},{"id":"graphql-angular-client","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-angular-client","source":"@site/blog/graphql-angular-clients-2024-07-20.md","title":"Apollo vs Urql vs Fetch: The Ultimate Showdown","description":"We pushed each method to its limits.

Apollo Angular - The Luxury Sports Car of GraphQL Clients\\n\\nFirst up on our list is Apollo Angular. If GraphQL clients were cars, Apollo would be the Tesla of the bunch - sleek, powerful, and packed with features you didn\'t even know you needed. Let\'s pop the hood and see what makes this beauty purr!\\n\\n#### Installation and Integration Steps\\n\\nBefore we can take Apollo for a spin, we need to get it set up in our garage (I mean, project). Here\'s how:\\n\\n1. **Install the necessary packages:**:\\n\\n   ```sh\\n   npm install apollo-angular @apollo/client graphql\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Configure Apollo in your `app.config.ts`**:\\n\\n   ```jsx\\n    import { APOLLO_OPTIONS, ApolloModule } from \'apollo-angular\';\\n    import { HttpLink } from \'apollo-angular/http\';\\n    import { InMemoryCache } from \'@apollo/client/core\';\\n\\n    // In your ApplicationConfig\\n    {\\n    providers: [\\n        importProvidersFrom(ApolloModule),\\n        {\\n        provide: APOLLO_OPTIONS,\\n        useFactory: (httpLink: HttpLink) => ({\\n            cache: new InMemoryCache(),\\n            link: httpLink.create({\\n            uri: \'/graphql\',\\n            }),\\n        }),\\n        deps: [HttpLink],\\n        },\\n    ],\\n    }\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Code Snippets**\\n   Now that we\'ve got our Apollo rocket fueled up, let\'s see it in action! Here\'s a component that fetches a list of posts using Apollo in `src/app/apollo-angular/post-list.component.ts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {Component, OnDestroy} from \\"@angular/core\\"\\nimport {CommonModule} from \\"@angular/common\\"\\nimport {Apollo, gql} from \\"apollo-angular\\"\\nimport {ChangeDetectorRef} from \\"@angular/core\\"\\nimport {\\n  catchError,\\n  takeUntil,\\n  mergeMap,\\n} from \\"rxjs/operators\\"\\nimport {Subject, of, throwError} from \\"rxjs\\"\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\"app-apollo-post-list\\",\\n  standalone: true,\\n  imports: [CommonModule],\\n  template: `\\n    <h2>Posts (Apollo Angular)</h2>\\n    <button (click)=\\"fetchPosts()\\" [disabled]=\\"loading\\">\\n      {{ loading ? \\"Loading...\\" : \\"Load Posts\\" }}\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerNetworkError()\\">\\n      Trigger Network Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerGraphQLError()\\">\\n      Trigger GraphQL Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerUnexpectedError()\\">\\n      Trigger Unexpected Error\\n    </button>\\n    <ul *ngIf=\\"!error\\">\\n      <li *ngFor=\\"let post of posts\\">{{ post.title }}</li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <div *ngIf=\\"error\\" class=\\"error-message\\">\\n      {{ error }}\\n    </div>\\n  `,\\n  styles: [\\n    `\\n      .error-message {\\n        color: red;\\n        margin-top: 10px;\\n      }\\n    `,\\n  ],\\n})\\nexport class ApolloPostListComponent implements OnDestroy {\\n  // ...

(error handling and simulation methods)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWow, would you look at that beauty? \ud83d\ude0d This component is like a finely tuned engine, ready to fetch your posts with the precision of a Swiss watch. Let\'s break down what\'s happening here:\\n\\n1. We\'re using Apollo\'s watchQuery method to fetch our posts. It\'s like having a personal assistant who\'s always on the lookout for the latest data.\\n2. We\'ve got some nifty error simulation methods. It\'s like having a crash test dummy for your data fetching - you can deliberately cause errors to see how your app handles them. Safety first, right?\\n3. The mergeMap operator is our traffic controller, deciding whether to let the data through or throw an error based on our simulation flags.\\n4. We\'re using takeUntil with a Subject to ensure we clean up our subscriptions when the component is destroyed. It\'s like having an eco-friendly car that doesn\'t leave any pollution (memory leaks) behind!\\n5. The template gives us a simple UI to fetch posts and trigger various error scenarios. It\'s like having a dashboard with different buttons to test your car\'s performance.\\n\\n#### Error Handling\\n\\nSpeaking of errors, Apollo doesn\'t just fetch data - it\'s got your back when things go wrong. Check out this error handling logic:\\n\\n```typescript\\n    private handleError(error: any) {\\n    this.loading = false;\\n    if (error.networkError) {\\n        this.error = \'Network error. Please check your internet connection.\';\\n    } else if (error.graphQLErrors) {\\n        this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.graphQLErrors\\n        .map((e: { message: any }) => e.message)\\n        .join(\', \')}`;\\n    } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n    }\\n    console.error(\'Error fetching posts\', error);\\n    this.cdr.detectChanges();\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThis error handler is like having a built-in mechanic. Whether it\'s a network issue (like running out of gas) or a GraphQL error (engine trouble), it\'s got you covered with user-friendly messages.\\n\\n#### Wrapping Up Apollo Angular\\n\\nAnd there you have it, folks! Apollo Angular - the smooth-riding, feature-packed, error-handling marvel of the GraphQL world. It\'s like driving a luxury car with a supercomputer onboard.\\n\\n### 2. Axios - The Versatile Muscle Car of HTTP Clients\\n\\nIf Apollo Angular is the luxury sports car of GraphQL clients, then Axios is like a classic muscle car - powerful, versatile, and ready to handle anything you throw at it. It might not have all the GraphQL-specific bells and whistles, but boy, can it perform!\\n\\n#### 1. Installation and Integration Steps\\n\\nBefore we hit the gas, let\'s get our Axios engine installed and tuned up:\\n\\n1. **Installations**.\\n\\nFirst, rev up your terminal and run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install axios\\n```\\n\\nUnlike Apollo, Axios doesn\'t need any special configuration in your app.config.ts. It\'s more of a plug-and-play solution. Just import it where you need it, and you\'re good to go!\\n\\n1. **Code Snippets**\\n\\nNow, below we implement data fetching using axios in `src/app/axios-angular/post-list.component.ts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {\\n  Component,\\n  OnInit,\\n  ChangeDetectorRef,\\n} from \\"@angular/core\\"\\nimport {CommonModule} from \\"@angular/common\\"\\nimport axios, {AxiosInstance, AxiosError} from \\"axios\\"\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\"app-axios-post-list\\",\\n  standalone: true,\\n  imports: [CommonModule],\\n  template: `\\n    <h2>Posts (Axios Angular)</h2>\\n    <button (click)=\\"fetchPosts()\\" [disabled]=\\"loading\\">\\n      {{ loading ? \\"Loading...\\" : \\"Load Posts\\" }}\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerNetworkError()\\">\\n      Trigger Network Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerGraphQLError()\\">\\n      Trigger GraphQL Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerUnexpectedError()\\">\\n      Trigger Unexpected Error\\n    </button>\\n    <ul *ngIf=\\"!error\\">\\n      <li *ngFor=\\"let post of posts\\">{{ post.title }}</li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <div *ngIf=\\"error\\" class=\\"error-message\\">\\n      {{ error }}\\n    </div>\\n  `,\\n  // ... (styles omitted for brevity)\\n})\\nexport class AxiosPostsListsComponent implements OnInit {\\n  private client: AxiosInstance\\n  posts: any[] = []\\n  loading = false\\n  error: string | null = null\\n\\n  // Error simulation flags\\n  private simulateNetworkError = false\\n  private simulateGraphQLError = false\\n  private simulateUnexpectedError = false\\n\\n  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {\\n    this.client = axios.create({\\n      baseURL: \\"/graphql\\",\\n      headers: {\\n        \\"Content-Type\\": \\"application/json\\",\\n      },\\n    })\\n  }\\n\\n  ngOnInit() {\\n    // Add a request interceptor\\n    this.client.interceptors.request.use(\\n      (config) => {\\n        if (this.simulateNetworkError) {\\n          return Promise.reject(\\n            new Error(\\"Simulated network error\\"),\\n          )\\n        }\\n        return config\\n      },\\n      (error) => Promise.reject(error),\\n    )\\n  }\\n\\n  private GET_DATA = `\\n        query GetPosts($limit: Int) {\\n        posts(limit: $limit) {\\n            id\\n            title\\n            ${this.simulateGraphQLError ? \\"nonExistentField\\" : \\"\\"}\\n        }\\n        }\\n    `\\n\\n  async query(queryString: string, variables: any = {}) {\\n    try {\\n      if (this.simulateUnexpectedError) {\\n        throw new Error(\\"Simulated unexpected error\\")\\n      }\\n      const response = await this.client.post(\\"\\", {\\n        query: queryString,\\n        variables,\\n      })\\n      return response.data\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      this.handleError(error)\\n      throw error\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  async fetchPosts() {\\n    this.loading = true\\n    this.error = null\\n    this.posts = []\\n    this.cdr.detectChanges()\\n\\n    try {\\n      const result = await this.query(this.GET_DATA, {\\n        limit: 10,\\n      })\\n      this.posts = result.data.posts\\n      this.loading = false\\n      this.cdr.detectChanges()\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      // Error is already handled in query method\\n      this.loading = false\\n      this.cdr.detectChanges()\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  // ... (error handling and simulation methods omitted for brevity)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis Axios-powered component is revving up to fetch those posts faster than you can say \\"GraphQL\\"! Let\'s break down what\'s happening in this high-octane code:\\n\\n1. We\'re creating an Axios instance in the constructor. It\'s like customizing your car with a specific paint job (baseURL) and some cool decals (headers).\\n2. The ngOnInit method adds a request interceptor. Think of it as a nitrous oxide system - it can give your requests an extra boost or, in this case, simulate a network error if you want to test your error handling.\\n3. Our query method is like the engine of this muscle car. It takes a GraphQL query string and variables, then fires off the request. If something goes wrong, it calls our trusty mechanic (the handleError method).\\n4. The fetchPosts method is where the rubber meets the road. It calls our query method with the posts query, then updates our component state with the results.\\n5. We\'ve got our error simulation methods, just like in the Apollo example. It\'s like having different test tracks for your muscle car - you can simulate various error conditions to make sure your code can handle any bumps in the road.\\n\\n#### 2. Error Handling\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about handling of errors:\\n\\n```typescript\\n    private handleError(error: any) {\\n    if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {\\n        const axiosError = error as AxiosError;\\n        if (axiosError.response) {\\n        // The request was made and the server responded with a status code\\n        // that falls out of the range of 2xx\\n        this.error = `Server error: ${axiosError.response.status} ${axiosError.response.statusText}`;\\n        } else if (axiosError.request) {\\n        // The request was made but no response was received\\n        this.error = \'Network error. Please check your internet connection.\';\\n        } else {\\n        // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n        }\\n    } else if (error.graphQLErrors) {\\n        this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.graphQLErrors\\n        .map((e: any) => e.message)\\n        .join(\', \')}`;\\n    } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n    }\\n    console.error(\'Error fetching posts:\', error);\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThis error handler is like the world\'s best shock absorber system. Whether you hit a pothole (network error), take a wrong turn (server error), or your engine misfires (unexpected error), it\'s got you covered with user-friendly messages. It even handles those tricky GraphQL-specific errors!\\n\\n#### Wrapping Up Axios\\n\\nAnd there you have it, Axios - the muscle car of HTTP clients, now tuned up to handle GraphQL queries with style. It might not have all the GraphQL-specific features of Apollo, but it\'s a powerhouse that can handle just about anything you throw at it.\\nAxios shines when you need a lightweight, versatile solution that can handle both REST and GraphQL APIs. It\'s like having a car that\'s equally at home on the racetrack and the city streets. Plus, if you\'re already familiar with Axios from REST API work, the learning curve here is as smooth as a freshly paved highway.\\n\\n### 3. Fetch API - The Lean, Mean, JavaScript Machine\\n\\nIf Apollo was our luxury sports car and Axios our muscle car, then the Fetch API is like a nimble, lightweight motorcycle. It\'s built right into modern browsers, requires no external libraries, and can zip through traffic with ease. Let\'s see how this speed demon handles our GraphQL queries!\\n\\n#### 1. Installation and Integration Steps\\n\\nHere\'s the beauty of the Fetch API - there\'s nothing to install! \ud83c\udf89 It\'s like finding out your new apartment comes with a free motorcycle in the garage. Just hop on and ride!\\n\\n#### 2. Code Snippets\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {Component, ChangeDetectorRef} from \\"@angular/core\\"\\nimport {CommonModule} from \\"@angular/common\\"\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\"app-fetch-post-list\\",\\n  standalone: true,\\n  imports: [CommonModule],\\n  template: `\\n    <h2>Posts (Fetch Angular)</h2>\\n    <button (click)=\\"fetchPosts()\\" [disabled]=\\"loading\\">\\n      {{ loading ? \\"Loading...\\" : \\"Load Posts\\" }}\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerNetworkError()\\">\\n      Trigger Network Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerGraphQLError()\\">\\n      Trigger GraphQL Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerUnexpectedError()\\">\\n      Trigger Unexpected Error\\n    </button>\\n    <ul *ngIf=\\"!error\\">\\n      <li *ngFor=\\"let post of posts\\">{{ post.title }}</li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <div *ngIf=\\"error\\" class=\\"error-message\\">\\n      {{ error }}\\n    </div>\\n  `,\\n  // ...

(error handling and simulation methods omitted for brevity)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis Fetch-powered component is leaner than a greyhound and faster than a caffeinated cheetah! Let\'s break down what\'s happening in this high-speed code:\\n\\n1. No imports needed for Fetch - it\'s built right into the browser. It\'s like having a motorcycle that doesn\'t need gas!\\n2. Our query method is the engine of this speed machine. It takes a GraphQL query string and variables, then zooms off to fetch the data.\\n3. We\'re using async/await syntax, which makes our asynchronous code read like a smooth ride down the highway.\\n4. The fetchPosts method is where we kick into high gear. It calls our query method with the posts query, then updates our component state with the results.\\n5. We\'ve still got our error simulation methods. It\'s like having different obstacle courses for our motorcycle - we can test how it handles in various tricky situations.\\n\\n#### Error Handling\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about the suspension system of our Fetch motorcycle - the error handling:\\n\\n```typescript\\n    private handleError(error: any) {\\n    if (error instanceof TypeError && error.message === \'Failed to fetch\') {\\n        this.error = \'Network error. Please check your internet connection.\';\\n    } else if (error instanceof Error) {\\n        if (error.message.includes(\'GraphQL error\')) {\\n        this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.message}`;\\n        } else if (error.message.startsWith(\'HTTP error!\')) {\\n        this.error = `Server error: ${error.message}`;\\n        } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n        }\\n    } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n    }\\n    console.error(\'Error fetching posts:\', error);\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThis error handler efficiently manages various error types. It provides user-friendly messages for network issues, server errors, unexpected problems, and GraphQL-specific errors, ensuring a smooth user experience even when things go wrong.\\n\\n#### Wrapping Up Fetch API\\n\\nAnd there you have it, The Fetch API - the nimble, lightweight motorcycle of HTTP clients, now revved up to handle GraphQL queries with style. It might not have all the bells and whistles of Apollo or the versatility of Axios, but it\'s fast, it\'s built-in, and it gets the job done with minimal fuss.\\n\\nFetch shines when you need a lightweight, no-dependency solution that can handle both REST and GraphQL APIs. It\'s like having a motorcycle that\'s equally at home zipping through city traffic or cruising on the open highway. Plus, if you\'re looking to keep your project dependencies to a minimum, Fetch is your go-to ride.\\n\\n### 4. GraphQL Request - The Precision-Engineered Sports Car\\n\\nIf Apollo was our luxury sedan, Axios our muscle car, and Fetch our nimble motorcycle, then GraphQL Request is like a finely-tuned sports car. It\'s designed specifically for GraphQL, offering a perfect balance of simplicity and power. Let\'s see how this beauty handles our data-fetching curves!\\n\\n1. **Installation and Integration Steps**\\n   Before we hit the track, let\'s get our GraphQL Request engine installed:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install graphql-request graphql\\n```\\n\\nNo special configuration needed in your app.config.ts. Just import it in your component, and you\'re ready to race!\\n\\n2. **Code Snippets**\\n\\nNow, let\'s pop the hood and examine our GraphQL Request-powered component:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {Component, ChangeDetectorRef} from \\"@angular/core\\"\\nimport {CommonModule} from \\"@angular/common\\"\\nimport {\\n  GraphQLClient,\\n  gql,\\n  ClientError,\\n} from \\"graphql-request\\"\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\"app-graphql-request-post-list\\",\\n  standalone: true,\\n  imports: [CommonModule],\\n  template: `\\n    <h2>Posts (Graphql Request Angular)</h2>\\n    <button (click)=\\"fetchPosts()\\" [disabled]=\\"loading\\">\\n      {{ loading ? \\"Loading...\\" : \\"Load Posts\\" }}\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerNetworkError()\\">\\n      Trigger Network Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerGraphQLError()\\">\\n      Trigger GraphQL Error\\n    </button>\\n    <button (click)=\\"triggerUnexpectedError()\\">\\n      Trigger Unexpected Error\\n    </button>\\n    <ul *ngIf=\\"!error\\">\\n      <li *ngFor=\\"let post of posts\\">{{ post.title }}</li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <div *ngIf=\\"error\\" class=\\"error-message\\">\\n      {{ error }}\\n    </div>\\n  `,\\n  // ...

(error handling and simulation methods omitted for brevity)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s break down what\'s happening in this high-performance code:\\n\\n1. We\'re importing GraphQLClient and gql from graphql-request. It\'s like having a custom-built engine and transmission, specifically designed for GraphQL roads.\\n2. In the constructor, we\'re initializing our GraphQLClient. It\'s like setting up the onboard computer of our sports car, telling it exactly where to go for our data.\\n3. Our GET_DATA query is defined using the gql tag. It\'s like programming the GPS with the exact route we want to take.\\n4. The fetchPosts method is where we put the pedal to the metal. We\'re using the client.request method, which is like engaging the launch control on our sports car - it handles everything for us, from acceleration to gear shifts.\\n5. We\'ve still got our error simulation methods. It\'s like having different road conditions we can simulate - wet roads, oil slicks, you name it!\\n\\n#### Error Handling\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about the advanced traction control system of our GraphQL Request sports car - the error handling:\\n\\n```typescript\\n    private handleError(error: any) {\\n    if (error instanceof ClientError) {\\n        if (error.response.errors) {\\n        // GraphQL errors\\n        this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.response.errors\\n            .map((e) => e.message)\\n            .join(\', \')}`;\\n        } else {\\n        // Network errors or other HTTP errors\\n        this.error = `Network error: ${error.response.status} ${error.response[\'statusText\']}`;\\n        }\\n    } else if (error instanceof Error) {\\n        if (error.message === \'Simulated network error\') {\\n        this.error = \'Network error. Please check your internet connection.\';\\n        } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n        }\\n    } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n    }\\n    console.error(\'Error fetching posts:\', error);\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThis error handler is like having the world\'s best traction control and stability management system. Whether you hit a patch of black ice (network error), take a corner too fast (GraphQL error), or encounter an unexpected obstacle (other errors), it\'s got you covered with user-friendly messages. It even distinguishes between different types of errors, giving you precise control over how to handle each situation.\\n\\n#### Wrapping Up GraphQL Request\\n\\nAnd there you have it, folks! GraphQL Request - the precision-engineered sports car of GraphQL clients. It\'s streamlined, efficient, and designed specifically for the twists and turns of GraphQL queries.\\nGraphQL Request shines when you need a lightweight, GraphQL-specific solution that offers more than Fetch but doesn\'t require the full ecosystem of Apollo. It\'s like having a sports car that\'s perfect for both daily commutes and weekend track days. Plus, its simplicity makes it a joy to work with, especially for smaller to medium-sized projects.\\n\\n### 5. Urql in Angular\\n\\n#### Installation and Integration Steps\\n\\nFirst things first, let\'s get our hands dirty with some installation magic. To bring Urql into your Angular project, you\'ll need to wave your command line wand and chant:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @urql/core graphql\\n```\\n\\nWe need to set up our Urql client.\\n\\n#### Code Snippets and Explanation\\n\\nLet\'s break down our UrqlPostListComponent which you\'ll create following the same format above and solder structure:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {\\n  createClient,\\n  fetchExchange,\\n  cacheExchange,\\n  Client,\\n} from \\"@urql/core\\"\\n\\n// ... other imports\\n\\nexport class UrqlPostListComponent {\\n  client: Client\\n\\n  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {\\n    this.client = createClient({\\n      url: \\"http://localhost:4200/graphql\\",\\n      exchanges: [cacheExchange, fetchExchange],\\n    })\\n  }\\n\\n  // ... rest of the component\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere, we\'re setting up our Urql client faster than you can say \\"GraphQL\\". We\'re telling it where to find our GraphQL endpoint and which exchanges to use. Think of exchanges as middleware for your GraphQL requests - they\'re like bouncers at a club, deciding how to handle incoming and outgoing traffic.\\n\\nNow, let\'s look at how we\'re fetching posts:\\n\\n```typescript\\n    getPostsQuery = gql`\\n    query GetPosts($limit: Int) {\\n        posts(limit: $limit) {\\n        id\\n        title\\n        }\\n    }\\n    `;\\n\\n    fetchPosts() {\\n    this.loading = true;\\n    this.error = null;\\n    this.posts = [];\\n    this.cdr.detectChanges();\\n\\n    this.client\\n        .query(this.getPostsQuery, { limit: 10 })\\n        .toPromise()\\n        .then((result) => {\\n        if (result.error) {\\n            this.handleError(result.error);\\n        } else {\\n            this.posts = result.data?.posts || [];\\n            this.loading = false;\\n            this.cdr.detectChanges();\\n        }\\n        })\\n        .catch((error) => this.handleError(error))\\n        .finally(() => {\\n        this.loading = false;\\n        this.cdr.detectChanges();\\n        });\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThis fetchPosts method is where the magic happens. We\'re using Urql\'s query method to fetch our posts, handling the result like a pro juggler. If there\'s an error, we toss it to our error handler. If it\'s successful, we update our posts faster than you can say \\"data fetched\\"!\\n\\n#### Error Handling\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about error handling. In the world of APIs, errors are like unexpected plot twists in a movie - they keep things interesting, but you need to know how to handle them:\\n\\n```typescript\\n    private handleError(error: any) {\\n    this.loading = false;\\n    if (error instanceof CombinedError) {\\n        if (error.networkError) {\\n        this.error = \'Network error. Please check your internet connection.\';\\n        } else if (error.graphQLErrors.length > 0) {\\n        this.error = `GraphQL error: ${error.graphQLErrors\\n            .map((e) => e.message)\\n            .join(\', \')}`;\\n        }\\n    } else if (error instanceof Error) {\\n        this.error = `An unexpected error occurred: ${error.message}`;\\n    } else {\\n        this.error = \'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\';\\n    }\\n    console.error(\'Error fetching posts:\', error);\\n    this.cdr.detectChanges();\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThis error handler is like a Swiss Army knife for API errors. Network error? We\'ve got you covered. GraphQL error? No problem. Unexpected error that makes you question the nature of reality? We handle that too!\\nWhy Choose Urql?\\nYou might be wondering, \\"Why should I choose Urql over other options?\\" Well, let me tell you, Urql is like that cool, efficient friend who always knows the best way to get things done:\\n\\n1. **Lightweight**: Urql is as light as a feather, which means your app won\'t feel like it\'s carrying extra baggage.\\n2. **Flexible**: It\'s adaptable to various use cases, like a chameleon in the coding world.\\n3. **Great Developer Experience**: With Urql, you\'ll feel like you\'re coding with a tailwind, not against a headwind.\\n\\n:::tip\\nWant to see all this in action?\\nCheck out our GitHub repo!\\n\\nWe\'ve put together a complete set of working examples for everything we\'ve covered in this article.

Let\'s recap and draw some final insights:\\n\\n1. **Apollo Angular** emerges as the powerhouse solution, offering a comprehensive feature set including robust caching, state management, and optimistic UI updates. It\'s ideal for large-scale applications with complex data requirements, though it comes with a steeper learning curve and larger bundle size.\\n\\n2. **Urql** strikes a balance between functionality and simplicity. Its lightweight nature and extensible architecture make it an excellent choice for projects that need flexibility without the full weight of Apollo. It\'s particularly suitable for medium-sized applications or teams that prefer a more customizable approach.\\n\\n3. **GraphQL-Request** shines in its simplicity. For small projects or microservices where basic GraphQL operations are all that\'s needed, it provides a no-frills solution with minimal overhead. However, it lacks built-in caching and advanced features, which may become limitations as your project grows.\\n\\n4. **Axios**, while not GraphQL-specific, leverages its widespread adoption and familiarity among developers. It\'s a solid choice for teams already using Axios in their stack or for projects that mix RESTful and GraphQL APIs. However, it requires more manual work for GraphQL-specific features.\\n\\n5. **Fetch API** represents the most lightweight approach, with zero additional bundle size. It\'s ideal for projects prioritizing minimal dependencies and maximum browser compatibility. However, it necessitates more boilerplate code and manual implementation of GraphQL-specific features.\\n\\nThe choice between these approaches ultimately depends on your project\'s specific needs, your team\'s expertise, and your application\'s scalability requirements. Here are some final recommendations:\\n\\n- For large, data-intensive applications with complex requirements, Apollo Angular is likely your best bet.\\n- If you\'re looking for a lightweight yet capable solution, Urql offers an excellent middle ground.\\n- For smaller projects or microservices, GraphQL-Request or Fetch API might be sufficient.\\n- If your project involves a mix of REST and GraphQL APIs, consider Axios for its versatility.\\n\\nRemember, there\'s no one-size-fits-all solution. The best approach is the one that aligns with your project\'s needs and your team\'s capabilities. As your application evolves, don\'t hesitate to reassess and switch approaches if necessary.\\n\\nWhichever path you choose, GraphQL\'s power in providing flexible, efficient data fetching can significantly enhance your Angular applications. By understanding these different approaches, you\'re now equipped to make an informed decision and leverage GraphQL to its full potential in your Angular projects.\\n\\nHappy coding, and may your GraphQL queries be ever efficient!"},{"id":"what-is-grpc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-is-grpc","source":"@site/blog/what-is-grpc-2024-07-13.mdx","title":"gRPC Decoded: The API Protocol That\'s Changing Everything","description":"Demystify gRPC and its impact on modern software architecture.

It enables efficient communication between services across different environments, utilizing a binary serialization format called Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) over HTTP/2.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\ngRPC plays a crucial role in modernizing software architectures by providing efficient, high-performance communication channels. Due to it\'s low-latency, it is used by many well-known software like Kubernetes, CockroachDB and Netflix etc.\\n\\n[An Example Snippet from Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0c8b3e5f305bf2bf56d47019199b81330d90c2c3/staging/src/k8s.io/kms/apis/v1beta1/api.proto#L29)\\n\\n_sample code for gRPC:_\\n\\n```protobuf\\n\\nsyntax = \\"proto3\\";\\n\\npackage greeting;\\n\\nservice GreetingService {\\n  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);\\n}\\n\\nmessage HelloRequest {\\n  string name = 1;\\n}\\n\\nmessage HelloResponse {\\n  string message = 1;\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n## The Evolution of API Communication\\n\\n![evolution](/images/docs/timeline.png)\\n\\nRequest\u2013response protocols date back to early distributed computing in the late 1960s. Theoretical proposals of remote procedure calls as the model of network operations date to the 1970s, with practical implementations emerging in the early 1980s. Traditional RPC mechanisms had limitations in terms of performance, language independence, and flexibility. gRPC addresses these issues by leveraging modern protocols and technologies.\\n\\ngRPC was initially created by Google, which used a single general-purpose RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect its numerous microservices. In 2015, Google decided to build the next version of Stubby and make it open source.\\n\\n## Understanding gRPC\\n\\ngRPC is a high-performance, language-neutral RPC framework. It uses Protobuf for serialization and HTTP/2 for transport, offering features like streaming, multiplexing, and bidirectional communication. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts.\\n\\n### Key components of gRPC\\n\\n- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf):** A language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It is used to define the structure of messages (request and response payloads) that gRPC services exchange.\\n\\n- **HTTP/2:** Provides additional capabilities such as multiplexing, header compression, and server push, which are not as efficient and reliable in HTTP/1.1\\n\\n### How gRPC works (step-by-step process)\\n\\n![step by step process](/images/docs/steps.png)\\n\\ngRPC (Remote Procedure Call) works using a straightforward yet powerful mechanism that facilitates communication between clients and servers in a distributed system.\\n\\n### 1. Service Definition\\n\\n- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**: The starting point for using gRPC is defining a service and its methods using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). Protobuf is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. The structure of data and services is defined in a `.proto` file.\\n\\n[An Example Snippet From Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/ad0546b488fad76879e654ad91ceed1e9e53d630/proto/common/net.proto#L4)\\n\\n_Example of a simple `.proto` file :_\\n\\n```protobuf\\nsyntax = \\"proto3\\";\\n\\npackage calculator;\\n\\nservice CalculatorService {\\n  rpc Add (AddRequest) returns (AddResponse);\\n}\\n\\nmessage AddRequest {\\n  double number1 = 1;\\n  double number2 = 2;\\n}\\n\\nmessage AddResponse {\\n  double result = 1;\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Code Generation\\n\\nOnce a service is defined in a .proto file, the Protocol Buffer compiler (protoc) is used to generate client and server code in your chosen programming languages. This step is crucial as it automates the creation of the boilerplate code needed for the gRPC service and client to communicate effectively. The generated code includes:\\n\\n- **Service Stubs:** These are classes with methods that correspond to the service methods defined in the .proto file. They handle the marshalling and unmarshalling of request and response messages, abstracting away the complexities of network communication.\\n\\n- **Client-Side Stubs:** These are used by the client application to make remote procedure calls to the server. The client stubs handle the creation and sending of requests, as well as receiving and processing responses.\\n\\nFor Example if the calculator example is converted to python, it would look something like this:\\n\\n```python\\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n# Generated by the protocol buffer compiler.

Client-Server Communication\\n\\n- **Transmission**:\\n  When a gRPC client initiates a request to a gRPC server, it sends an HTTP/2 request containing the service name, specific method, and serialized parameters using Protobuf. HTTP/2\'s advantages include multiplexing, enabling concurrent handling of multiple streams over a single connection, binary framing that minimizes overhead and accelerates data exchange, efficient header compression via HPACK, and integrated flow control mechanisms.\\n\\n### 4. Serialization and Deserialization\\n\\n- **Protobuf Serialization**: Data exchanged between gRPC clients and servers is serialized and deserialized using Protobuf.\\n\\n## gRPC Service Methods\\n\\n![gRPC Methods](/images/docs/methods.png)\\n\\n- **Unary RPC**: This is the simplest form where the client sends a single request to the server and receives a single response:\\n\\n  ```protobuf\\n  service MyService { rpc UnaryExample(MyRequest) returns (MyResponse); }\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Server Streaming RPC**: The client sends a request to the server and receives a stream of responses:\\n\\n  ```protobuf\\n  service MyService { rpc UnaryExample(MyRequest) returns (stream MyResponse); }\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Client Streaming RPC**: The client sends a stream of requests to the server and receives a single response:\\n\\n  ```protobuf\\n  service MyService { rpc UnaryExample(stream MyRequest) returns (MyResponse); }\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Bidirectional Streaming RPC**: Both the client and server send a stream of messages to each other, establishing a persistent connection:\\n  ```protobuf\\n  service MyService { rpc UnaryExample(stream MyRequest) returns (stream MyResponse); }\\n  ```\\n\\n## gRPC vs. REST: Basic Comparison\\n\\n![payload size comparison](/images/docs/size-compare.png)\\n\\n_A comparison of payload sizes: REST JSON vs gRPC binary [checkout full comparison ](https://nilsmagnus.github.io/post/proto-json-sizes/)_\\n\\n### Communication model\\n\\n- **gRPC:** RPC-based, strong typing, and allows unary and bi-directional streaming, making it feasible for modern-day applications and use-cases.\\n- **REST:** Stateless, used for CRUD-based operations over HTTP, follows a simple unary request/response cycle.\\n\\n### Data format and serialization\\n\\n- **gRPC:** Uses Protobuf for efficient binary serialization.\\n- **REST:** Uses a plain-text format like JSON and XML, which requires more processing in order to parse.\\n\\n### Use cases for each\\n\\n- **gRPC:** Suitable for internal microservices, real-time applications, and situations needing high-performance and time-sensitive communication.\\n- **REST:** Better for public APIs, browser-based applications, and situations requiring stateless operations where ease of use is a priority.\\n\\n## Advantages of gRPC\\n\\n### Efficiency and performance\\n\\n![gRPC performance](/images/docs/grpc_performance.webp)\\n\\nProtobuf efficiently serializes messages on both the server and client sides, ensuring that data is transmitted in a compact binary format. This results in smaller message payloads, which are quicker to transmit over the network compared to the verbose JSON format used in REST APIs.\\n\\nIn addition, HTTP/2 uses features like header-compression, multiplexing and server-push which significantly reduce the payload size, as well as make response faster.\\n\\nThese features collectively contribute to significant performance gains, making gRPC [7-10 times](https://medium.com/@EmperorRXF/evaluating-performance-of-rest-vs-grpc-1b8bdf0b22da) faster than traditional REST APIs using JSON.\\n\\n### Language-agnostic nature\\n\\n![gRPC Language Agnostic](/images/docs/language_agnostic.png)\\n\\ngRPC uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) as its (IDL) for describing both the structure and the semantics of the messages sent between clients and servers. Protobuf is independent of programming languages, meaning you can define your API once using Protobuf and then generate code in various languages to interact with it. This allows seamless integration of sub-systems API specification, while also enhancing the DX.\\n\\n### Strong typing and code generation\\n\\nProtocol Buffers (Protobuf) defines both the structure and the types of messages exchanged between clients and servers within a .proto file, thereby establishing a clear and standardized API contract. This contract specifies the fields and their data types for each message, ensuring consistency and predictability in communication. By enforcing strong typing, Protobuf enhances code reliability by detecting type-related errors during compilation rather than at runtime. This approach not only prevents type mismatches and potential bugs but also saves developers time that would otherwise be spent implementing manual type-checking. Additionally, Protobuf\'s built-in type safety simplifies the development process, allowing developers to focus more on business logic and less on handling data integrity issues, thus improving the developer experience.\\n\\n### Bidirectional streaming capabilities\\n\\nUnlike traditional RPC methods that are unidirectional (either client-to-server or server-to-client), gRPC\'s bidirectional streaming allows both parties to establish a persistent connection and send a sequence of messages asynchronously.\\n\\nBidirectional streaming is particularly beneficial for applications requiring interactive and responsive communication, such as chat systems, collaborative tools, multiplayer games, and real-time data feeds.\\n\\n### Extensibility and backward compatibility\\n\\ngRPC using Protobuf as the IDL opens support for extensibility by allowing new fields, messages, and services to be added to the `.proto` file definitions. As services evolve, these changes can be propagated through automated code generation using the `protoc` compiler, which produces language-specific stubs and serializers/deserializers.\\n\\nMoreover, explicit versioning and API contracts defined in the `.proto` files help manage compatibility between different versions of services. During the RPC connection handshake, gRPC allows clients and servers to negotiate capabilities, ensuring that both parties can communicate effectively even if they support different versions or extensions.\\n\\n**_Example:_**\\n\\n```protobuf\\nsyntax = \\"proto3\\";\\n\\npackage greet.v1;\\n\\nservice Greeter {\\n  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);\\n}\\n\\nmessage HelloRequest {\\n  string name = 1;\\n}\\n\\nmessage HelloReply {\\n  string message = 1;\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Challenges and Considerations\\n\\n### Learning curve\\n\\ngRPC has a much steeper learning curve compared to the traditional REST, mainly due to some new concepts like HTTP/2 and Protobuf which require significant practice and experience.\\n\\n### Debugging complexity\\n\\nDebugging gRPC applications can be really challenging compared to traditional REST APIs. The binary nature of Protobuf messages makes it difficult to inspect and manipulate payloads directly. Tools for debugging and tracing gRPC calls are available, but they often require additional setup and expertise.\\n\\n### Ecosystem maturity\\n\\nWhile gRPC has gained significant traction and support, its ecosystem is still maturing compared to REST. Some languages and frameworks may have limited or incomplete support for gRPC features. Additionally, there is less developer support on the internet, less browser-support and very few articles published which makes it challenging to learn especially for beginners.\\n\\n### Browser support limitations\\n\\nCurrent browser limitations prevent direct implementation of the HTTP/2 gRPC specification. Browsers lack the necessary APIs to provide fine-grained control over requests. For instance:\\n\\n1. There\'s no way to enforce the use of HTTP/2.\\n2. Even if HTTP/2 could be enforced, browsers can\'t access raw HTTP/2 frames.\\n\\nTo address these limitations, the gRPC-Web specification was developed. It builds upon the HTTP/2 spec but introduces key differences:\\n\\n1. Support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols.\\n2. A new method for handling gRPC trailers:\\n   - Trailers are sent at the very end of request/response bodies.\\n   - A new bit in the gRPC message header indicates the presence of trailers.\\n3. Requirement of a proxy server:\\n   - This proxy translates between gRPC-Web requests and standard gRPC HTTP/2 responses.\\n   - It\'s a mandatory component in the gRPC-Web architecture.\\n\\nThese adaptations allow gRPC-like functionality in web browsers while working within current browser constraints.\\n\\ngRPC is powerful for service to service communication, but it may not be the best choice for public APIs or browser-based applications where REST/GraphQL is more prevalent.\\n\\n:::tip\\nTo seamlessly integrate the benefits of both gRPC and GraphQL, you can easily generate GraphQL from gRPC using Tailcall. Check out the documentation here:\\n\\n- [gRPC to GraphQL](https://tailcall.run/docs/graphql-grpc-tailcall/) .\\n- [Automated gRPC to GraphQL](https://tailcall.run/docs/graphql-configuration-generation-with-tailcall/#effortless-grpc-integration)\\n  :::\\n\\n## Implementing gRPC: Best Practices\\n\\n### Designing Effective Protobuf Schemas\\n\\nCreating efficient and maintainable Protobuf schemas is crucial. Use meaningful field names and provide clear comments for each field, otherwise you may end up in a nested jargon of types! Versioning schemas properly ensures backward and forward compatibility makes it easier to evolve your API without breaking existing clients.\\n\\n### Error Handling and Status Codes\\n\\nDefine and document all possible error codes your service can return. Consistent and informative error messages aid in debugging and provide a better experience for developers integrating with your API, if the API is not verbose about the error, the developer trying to integrate the API on the other side may get frustrated:\\n\\n:::info\\n**_A bad API is like a traffic jam - frustrating, confusing, and costly._**\\n[ - Joshua Bloch](https://www.twitter.com/joshbloch)\\n:::\\n\\n### Security Considerations (Authentication, Encryption)\\n\\nSecure your gRPC services by implementing authentication and encryption. Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between clients and servers. Leverage gRPC\'s support for various authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth, JWT, or custom tokens, to ensure that only authorized clients can access your services.\\n\\n### Performance Optimization Techniques\\n\\ngRPC API performance can be boosted in many ways. The channels are expensive to make, and reusing them instead of remaking has a significant impact.\\n\\n**_Example:_**\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst grpc = require(\\"grpc\\")\\n\\n// Singleton instance for the gRPC channel\\nlet channel = null\\n\\nfunction getGrpcChannel() {\\n  if (!channel) {\\n    // Create a new channel if it doesn\'t exist\\n    channel = new grpc.Client(\\"localhost:50051\\", grpc.credentials.createInsecure())\\n  }\\n  return channel\\n}\\n\\n// Example usage:\\nconst myChannel = getGrpcChannel()\\n// Use `myChannel` to make gRPC calls\\n```\\n\\nAlongside with reusing channels, many other ways can improve performance like implementing [load-balancers](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-load-balancing/) and using streaming instead of unary where needed.\\n\\n## gRPC Use Cases and Real-World Examples\\n\\n### Microservices Architecture\\n\\ngRPC is well-suited for microservices architectures, enabling efficient communication between services. Companies like Netflix and Google use gRPC to connect their microservices, benefiting from its performance and strong typing.

Its support for bidirectional streaming allows for seamless and efficient data exchange between clients and servers, enabling real-time interactions and reducing latency.\\n\\n[A snippet from Open-Match, a gaming framework:](https://github.com/googleforgames/open-match/blob/d781be1a3ce1b6b7fce495345b23256089f55de9/api/backend.proto#L132)\\n\\n```protobuf\\n\\n  // Tickets in matches returned by FetchMatches are moved from active to\\n  // pending, and will not be returned by query.\\n  rpc FetchMatches(FetchMatchesRequest) returns (stream FetchMatchesResponse) {\\n    option (google.api.http) = {\\n      post: \\"/v1/backendservice/matches:fetch\\"\\n      body: \\"*\\"\\n    };\\n  }\\n\\n```\\n\\n### IoT and Edge Computing\\n\\nIn IoT and edge computing scenarios, gRPC\'s low overhead and efficient communication make it suitable for resource-constrained devices. It enables reliable communication between edge devices and central servers, facilitating data collection, processing, and command execution in real time.\\n\\n### Mobile and Web Applications\\n\\ngRPC is increasingly used in mobile and web applications to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage. For example, companies like Lyft use gRPC to enhance the efficiency of their mobile apps, ensuring faster response times and a smoother user experience.\\n\\n## Tools and Frameworks for gRPC Development\\n\\n### Popular gRPC Libraries for Different Languages\\n\\ngRPC has libraries and tooling support for various programming languages:\\n\\n- [gRPC Core](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) - C, C++, Ruby, Node.js, Python, PHP, C#, Objective-C\\n- [gRPC Java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) - The Java gRPC implementation.

Its ability to handle high-performance, low-latency communication is essential for the scalability and reliability of cloud-native architectures.\\n\\n### Potential Improvements and Extensions\\n\\nThe gRPC ecosystem is continuously evolving, with potential improvements and extensions on the horizon. Enhancements in tooling, support for more languages, better integration with existing frameworks, and increased adoption of gRPC-Web are some areas of expected growth. The community\'s efforts to address current limitations will make gRPC more accessible and robust for a wider range of applications.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n#### Recap of gRPC\'s key features and benefits\\n\\nIn summary, gRPC offers efficient, low-latency communication, strong typing through Protobuf, and support for multiple languages. Its bidirectional streaming and multiplexing capabilities make it ideal for real-time and microservices-based applications. The performance and reliability of gRPC provide significant advantages over traditional REST APIs in many scenarios, mainly because of the new HTTP/2 and its binary nature.\\n\\n#### Considerations for Adopting gRPC in Projects\\n\\nWhen considering gRPC for your projects, ensure that your team is prepared to handle the challenges and leverage the best practices discussed to design, implement, and maintain robust gRPC services. Make sure you have enough support resources and officials, as gRPC doesn\'t have a community as large as REST.\\n\\n### Further Resources\\n\\n#### Official documentation and tutorials\\n\\n- [gRPC Official Documentation](https://grpc.io/)\\n\\n#### Community forums and support\\n\\n- [gRPC Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/grpcio)\\n- [gRPC StackOverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/grpc)\\n- [gRPC Gitter room](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#grpc_grpc:gitter.im)\\n- [gRPC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io)\\n\\n#### Books for in-depth learning\\n\\n- [gRPC: Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/grpc-up-and/9781492058328/)\\n- [gRPC Microservices in Go](https://www.manning.com/books/grpc-microservices-in-go)"},{"id":"graphql-introspection-security","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-introspection-security","source":"@site/blog/graphql-introspection-security-2024-7-12.md","title":"Are Hackers Using Your Own GraphQL API Against You?","description":"Learn how attackers exploit GraphQL introspection and the battle-tested strategies to keep your data safe.","date":"2024-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"GraphQL","permalink":"/blog/tags/graph-ql"},{"inline":true,"label":"Schema","permalink":"/blog/tags/schema"},{"inline":true,"label":"Security","permalink":"/blog/tags/security"},{"inline":true,"label":"Introspection","permalink":"/blog/tags/introspection"}],"readingTime":6.42,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Are Hackers Using Your Own GraphQL API Against You?","authors":[{"name":"Amit Singh","title":"Head of Growth and Strategy @ Tailcall","url":"https://github.com/amitksingh1490","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23661702?v=5"}],"tags":["GraphQL","Schema","Security","Introspection"],"description":"Learn how attackers exploit GraphQL introspection and the battle-tested strategies to keep your data safe.","hide_table_of_contents":true,"slug":"graphql-introspection-security","image":"/images/blog/introspection-issues.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"gRPC Decoded: The API Protocol That\'s Changing Everything","permalink":"/blog/what-is-grpc"},"nextItem":{"title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 1","permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema"}},"content":"GraphQL has taken the API world by storm, offering developers a flexible and powerful way to interact with backend systems. But with great power comes great responsibility\u2014especially when it comes to security.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLet\'s dive into one of GraphQL\'s most fascinating features: introspection. It\'s a double-edged sword that can be both a developer\'s best friend and a security expert\'s nightmare.\\n\\n## Understanding GraphQL Introspection\\n\\nImagine having a magical lens that lets you peek into the very structure of a GraphQL server. That\'s essentially what introspection does! It\'s like having a detailed map of a treasure trove, showing you every nook and cranny of the API\'s capabilities. This self-documenting capability is incredibly useful for developers, enabling tools like GraphiQL and GraphQL Playground to provide rich, interactive documentation and auto-completion features.\\n\\nA basic introspection query might look like this:\\n\\n```graphql\\n{\\n  __schema {\\n    types {\\n      name\\n      fields {\\n        name\\n        type {\\n          name\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis query asks the server to return information about all the types in the schema, including their fields and field types. The server\'s response provides a comprehensive map of its structure, which can be invaluable during development.\\n\\n## The Security Implications of Introspection\\n\\nWhile introspection is a goldmine for developers, it can also be a treasure map for attackers. Let\'s put on our black hat for a moment and see how a malicious actor might exploit this feature.\\n\\n### Schema Reconnaissance\\n\\nOne of the primary risks of introspection is schema reconnaissance. An attacker who gains access to a GraphQL endpoint can use introspection to explore the schema and identify potential targets for further attacks. This includes discovering sensitive types and fields, as well as understanding the relationships between different parts of the schema. Armed with this knowledge, an attacker can craft more effective queries to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.\\n\\nFor instance, an attacker might discover a \'User\' type with fields like \'email\', \'password\', and \'isAdmin\'. They could then craft a query to exploit this:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  allUsers {\\n    email\\n    password\\n    isAdmin\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf not properly secured, this query could potentially expose sensitive user data. The attacker might also notice an \'updateUser\' mutation, which could be a target for privilege escalation attempts.\\n\\n### Information Disclosure\\n\\nAnother significant risk is information disclosure. The introspection feature can inadvertently reveal implementation details that should remain hidden. This includes internal types, deprecated fields, and administrative functionalities. Such exposure can give attackers clues about the underlying system architecture and any potential weaknesses.\\n\\n### Attack Surface Expansion\\n\\nBy using introspection, attackers can significantly expand their attack surface. They can identify entry points for various attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and denial of service (DoS) attacks. For instance, if introspection reveals that certain fields accept user input, an attacker might probe these fields for injection vulnerabilities.\\n\\n## Mitigating Introspection Risks\\n\\nNow, let\'s switch gears and become the defenders of our GraphQL realm. Here are some battle-tested strategies to keep your API safe from prying eyes:\\n\\n### Disable Introspection in Production\\n\\nDisabling introspection in production is crucial because it significantly reduces the information available to potential attackers. Without introspection, they can\'t easily map out your API\'s structure or discover hidden fields and types. This forces attackers to rely on guesswork or prior knowledge, making their job much more difficult. However, it\'s important to note that this is not a silver bullet\u2014determined attackers may still attempt to reverse-engineer your API through trial and error.\\n\\nIn many GraphQL implementations, disabling introspection is straightforward. For example, in [Tailcall](https://tailcall.run/docs/tailcall-dsl-graphql-custom-directives/#introspection), you can disable introspection by setting the `introspection` option to `false`:\\n\\n```graphql\\nschema\\n  # highlight-next-line\\n  @server(introspection: false) {\\n  query: Query\\n  mutation: Mutation\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration ensures that introspection is disabled.\\n\\n### Implement Authentication and Authorization\\n\\nAnother critical measure is to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. By ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access your GraphQL endpoint, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized introspection queries. Use industry-standard authentication protocols such as OAuth2 or JWT to secure your endpoints.\\n\\nImagine a GraphQL API for a banking application. You might implement role-based access control where only users with an \'ADMIN\' role can access certain fields or mutations.\\n\\nIn [Tailcall](https://tailcall.run/docs/field-level-access-control-graphql-authentication/), you can achieve this by using the `@protected` directive.\\n\\nTailcall supports a variety of authentication and authorization mechanisms, including JWT, OAuth2, and custom authentication strategies.\\n\\nThis ensures that even if an attacker gains access to a regular user account, they can\'t use it to access sensitive admin-only data or operations.\\n\\n### Rate Limiting and Throttling\\n\\nRate limiting and throttling can also help mitigate the risks of introspection. By limiting the number of queries a client can execute within a given timeframe, you can reduce the likelihood of an attacker using introspection to gather information about your schema. Implementing these controls can also help protect your server from DoS attacks.\\n\\n### Query Allow Lists\\n\\nQuery allow lists work by pre-registering all valid queries that your application needs. This is typically done during the build process of your frontend application. Each query is hashed, and these hashes are stored on the server. When a query comes in, its hash is checked against the allow list.\\n\\nFor example, you might have a client-side query like this:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery GetUserProfile($id: ID!) {\\n  user(id: $id) {\\n    name\\n    email\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis query would be hashed and stored on the server. When executed, the server checks if the incoming query\'s hash matches any in its allow list. If not, it\'s rejected.\\n\\nThis approach is powerful because it completely prevents arbitrary queries, including introspection queries, from being executed. It does require more setup and maintenance, especially in applications where queries change frequently, but it provides a very high level of security.\\n\\n### Monitor and Log Introspection Queries\\n\\nMonitoring and logging introspection queries can provide valuable insights into potential security threats. By tracking when and how introspection queries are executed, you can identify suspicious activity and respond accordingly. Implement logging at both the application and network levels to capture detailed information about each query.\\n\\n### Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)\\n\\nA WAF can be particularly effective for GraphQL APIs because it can be configured to understand GraphQL-specific threats. For instance, you can set up rules to:\\n\\n1. Limit query depth: Prevent deeply nested queries that could overload your server.\\n2. Restrict field counts: Avoid overly broad queries that request too many fields at once.\\n3. Block known malicious patterns: Such as attempts to inject malicious code into queries.\\n\\nFor example, a WAF rule might look like this:\\n\\n```\\nSecRule ARGS_POST:query \\"@contains __schema\\" \\\\\\n    \\"id:1000,\\\\\\n    phase:2,\\\\\\n    t:none,\\\\\\n    block,\\\\\\n    msg:\'GraphQL introspection query detected\'\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis rule would block any POST request containing \'\\\\_\\\\_schema\' in the query parameter, which is typically indicative of an introspection query.\\n\\nBy implementing these kinds of rules, a WAF adds an extra layer of protection, catching many potential attacks before they even reach your GraphQL server.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSecuring GraphQL is like playing a high-stakes game of chess. You need to think several moves ahead, anticipating potential threats while leveraging the strengths of your position. By implementing these strategies, you\'re not just protecting your API\u2014you\'re ensuring that GraphQL\'s power remains in the right hands. Stay vigilant, keep learning, and may your queries be ever secure!\\n\\nBy prioritizing security in your GraphQL implementation, you can harness the power of this modern query language while safeguarding your data and maintaining the trust of your users. Securing GraphQL is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and a proactive approach. Stay informed about the latest security developments, regularly review and update your security measures, and ensure that your development and security teams are aligned in their efforts to protect your applications."},{"id":"graphql-schema","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-schema","source":"@site/blog/graphql-schema-2024-07-11.md","title":"Design a GraphQL Schema So Good, It\'ll Make REST APIs Cry - Part 1","description":"Learn how to design a robust, scalable GraphQL schema.

In this comprehensive guide, we\'ll walk through the process of crafting a GraphQL schema for a real-world application, highlighting best practices and considerations along the way.\\n\\nIf you are thinking how we could possibly cover all of the lovely intricacies associated with this topic in one go, you are right, we can\'t and so we are not! We have created an amazing series to take you through the nuances of working with GraphQL schemas.\\n\\nLet\'s break our job into puzzle pieces. Let\'s start by simply creating designing a brand new schema!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\', margin:\'16px\'}}>\\n\\n<img src=\\"/images/blog/puzzle-graphql-schema-1.png\\" alt=\\"puzzle piece to visualise the series\\" style={{maxWidth: \'40%\'}} />\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIf you\'re new to GraphQL Schema, check out our [GraphQL Schema Tutorial](https://tailcall.run/graphql/schemas-and-types/) to get up to speed with the basics.\\n\\n## The Power of GraphQL Schemas\\n\\nA well-designed GraphQL schema serves as the blueprint for your entire API. It defines:\\n\\n- The types of data available\\n- The relationships between those types\\n- The operations clients can perform (queries, mutations, subscriptions)\\n- The structure of requests and responses\\n\\nYour schema acts as a contract between your backend and frontend teams. Once published, clients can rely on its structure, enabling them to build UIs with confidence. A thoughtful schema design upfront can save significant refactoring down the road.\\n\\n## Our Example Application: TechTalent\\n\\nTo illustrate schema design principles, let\'s imagine we\'re building TechTalent - a platform connecting tech companies with job seekers. Our application will allow:\\n\\n- Companies to post job listings\\n- Candidates to create profiles and apply to jobs\\n- Recruiters to search candidates and manage applications\\n\\nWe\'ll design our schema step-by-step to support these core features.\\n\\n## Step 1: Identify Core Types\\n\\nThe first step is to identify the main entities in our domain. For TechTalent, our core types might include:\\n\\n- Company\\n- JobListing\\n- Candidate\\n- Application\\n- Recruiter\\n\\nLet\'s start by defining these as object types in our schema:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Company {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  description: String\\n  # More fields to come\\n}\\n\\ntype JobListing {\\n  id: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  description: String!\\n  # More fields to come\\n}\\n\\ntype Candidate {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  # More fields to come\\n}\\n\\ntype Application {\\n  id: ID!\\n  # More fields to come\\n}\\n\\ntype Recruiter {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  # More fields to come\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNotice we\'ve only included a few basic fields at this stage. We\'ll flesh these out as we progress.\\n\\n## Step 2: Model Relationships\\n\\nNext, we need to consider how these types relate to each other. In GraphQL, we model relationships by adding fields that reference other types. Let\'s update our types:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Company {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  description: String\\n  jobListings: [JobListing!]!\\n  recruiters: [Recruiter!]!\\n}\\n\\ntype JobListing {\\n  id: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  description: String!\\n  company: Company!\\n  applications: [Application!]!\\n}\\n\\ntype Candidate {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  applications: [Application!]!\\n}\\n\\ntype Application {\\n  id: ID!\\n  jobListing: JobListing!\\n  candidate: Candidate!\\n  status: ApplicationStatus!\\n}\\n\\ntype Recruiter {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n  company: Company!\\n}\\n\\nenum ApplicationStatus {\\n  PENDING\\n  REVIEWED\\n  REJECTED\\n  ACCEPTED\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe\'ve now established the core relationships:\\n\\n- Companies have job listings and recruiters\\n- Job listings belong to a company and have applications\\n- Candidates have applications\\n- Applications link a candidate to a job listing\\n- Recruiters belong to a company\\n\\nNote the use of the `ApplicationStatus` enum to represent the fixed set of possible statuses.\\n\\n## Step 3: Plan Query Operations\\n\\nWith our core types defined, let\'s consider what query operations our clients will need. We\'ll start with some basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  company(id: ID!): Company\\n  jobListing(id: ID!): JobListing\\n  candidate(id: ID!): Candidate\\n\\n  # List operations\\n  companies: [Company!]!\\n  jobListings(filters: JobListingFilters): [JobListing!]!\\n  candidates(filters: CandidateFilters): [Candidate!]!\\n}\\n\\ninput JobListingFilters {\\n  companyId: ID\\n  title: String\\n  # Add more filter options\\n}\\n\\ninput CandidateFilters {\\n  skills: [String!]\\n  experienceYears: Int\\n  # Add more filter options\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe\'ve added basic queries to fetch individual entities by ID, as well as list queries for our main types. Notice the use of `input` types for filters - this allows for more flexible and extensible querying.\\n\\n## Step 4: Plan Mutation Operations\\n\\nNext, let\'s define some mutation operations to allow clients to modify data:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Mutation {\\n  # Company mutations\\n  createCompany(\\n    input: CreateCompanyInput!\\n  ): CreateCompanyPayload!\\n  updateCompany(\\n    id: ID!\\n    input: UpdateCompanyInput!\\n  ): UpdateCompanyPayload!\\n\\n  # Job Listing mutations\\n  createJobListing(\\n    input: CreateJobListingInput!\\n  ): CreateJobListingPayload!\\n  updateJobListing(\\n    id: ID!\\n    input: UpdateJobListingInput!\\n  ): UpdateJobListingPayload!\\n\\n  # Candidate mutations\\n  createCandidate(\\n    input: CreateCandidateInput!\\n  ): CreateCandidatePayload!\\n  updateCandidate(\\n    id: ID!\\n    input: UpdateCandidateInput!\\n  ): UpdateCandidatePayload!\\n\\n  # Application mutations\\n  submitApplication(\\n    input: SubmitApplicationInput!\\n  ): SubmitApplicationPayload!\\n  updateApplicationStatus(\\n    id: ID!\\n    status: ApplicationStatus!\\n  ): UpdateApplicationStatusPayload!\\n}\\n\\n# Input and Payload types for each mutation...\\n```\\n\\nNotice the pattern we\'re using for mutations:\\n\\n1. Each mutation has a corresponding input type\\n2. Each mutation returns a payload type\\n\\nThis structure offers several benefits:\\n\\n- Input types allow for easy addition of new fields in the future\\n- Payload types can include both the modified entity and any errors or metadata\\n- It provides a consistent structure across all mutations\\n\\nLet\'s look at an example input and payload type:\\n\\n```graphql\\ninput CreateJobListingInput {\\n  companyId: ID!\\n  title: String!\\n  description: String!\\n  requirements: [String!]!\\n  salary: SalaryInput\\n}\\n\\ninput SalaryInput {\\n  min: Int!\\n  max: Int!\\n  currency: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype CreateJobListingPayload {\\n  jobListing: JobListing\\n  errors: [Error!]\\n}\\n\\ntype Error {\\n  message: String!\\n  path: [String!]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis structure allows for detailed error reporting and future extensibility.\\n\\n## Step 5: Consider Authentication and Authorization\\n\\nIn a production application, we need to consider authentication and authorization. Let\'s add some operations for user management:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Mutation {\\n  # ... previous mutations\\n\\n  signup(input: SignupInput!): AuthPayload!\\n  login(input: LoginInput!): AuthPayload!\\n  logout: Boolean!\\n}\\n\\ninput SignupInput {\\n  email: String!\\n  password: String!\\n  name: String!\\n  role: UserRole!\\n}\\n\\ninput LoginInput {\\n  email: String!\\n  password: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype AuthPayload {\\n  token: String!\\n  user: User!\\n}\\n\\ntype User {\\n  id: ID!\\n  email: String!\\n  name: String!\\n  role: UserRole!\\n}\\n\\nenum UserRole {\\n  CANDIDATE\\n  RECRUITER\\n  ADMIN\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe\'ve added basic authentication operations and a `User` type to represent authenticated users. In a real-world scenario, you\'d likely want to implement more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.\\n\\n## Step 6: Implement Pagination\\n\\nAs our application grows, we\'ll need to implement pagination for our list queries. Let\'s update our `jobListings` query to use cursor-based pagination:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  # ... other queries\\n\\n  jobListings(\\n    first: Int\\n    after: String\\n    filters: JobListingFilters\\n  ): JobListingConnection!\\n}\\n\\ntype JobListingConnection {\\n  edges: [JobListingEdge!]!\\n  pageInfo: PageInfo!\\n}\\n\\ntype JobListingEdge {\\n  node: JobListing!\\n  cursor: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype PageInfo {\\n  hasNextPage: Boolean!\\n  endCursor: String\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis implementation follows the Relay connection specification, which provides a standardized way to handle pagination in GraphQL.\\n\\n## Step 7: Plan for Real-time Updates\\n\\nFor certain features, we might want to provide real-time updates. Let\'s add a subscription to notify when new job listings are posted:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Subscription {\\n  newJobListing: JobListing!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nClients can subscribe to this operation to receive updates whenever a new job listing is created.\\n\\n## Step 8: Implement Custom Scalars\\n\\nOur schema might benefit from some custom scalar types for specific data formats. For example, let\'s add a `DateTime` scalar:\\n\\n```graphql\\nscalar DateTime\\n\\ntype JobListing {\\n  # ... other fields\\n  postedAt: DateTime!\\n  applicationDeadline: DateTime\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe\'ll need to implement the serialization/deserialization logic for this scalar in our resolvers.\\n\\n## Step 9: Use Interfaces for Shared Fields\\n\\nAs our schema grows, we might notice some types sharing common fields. We can use interfaces to model this shared structure:\\n\\n```graphql\\ninterface Node {\\n  id: ID!\\n}\\n\\ninterface Timestamped {\\n  createdAt: DateTime!\\n  updatedAt: DateTime!\\n}\\n\\ntype Company implements Node & Timestamped {\\n  id: ID!\\n  createdAt: DateTime!\\n  updatedAt: DateTime!\\n  # ... other fields\\n}\\n\\ntype JobListing implements Node & Timestamped {\\n  id: ID!\\n  createdAt: DateTime!\\n  updatedAt: DateTime!\\n  # ... other fields\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis approach promotes consistency and can make it easier to implement features that work across multiple types.\\n\\n## Step 10: Document Your Schema\\n\\nFinally, it\'s crucial to document your schema thoroughly. GraphQL allows for built-in documentation:\\n\\n```graphql\\n\\"\\"\\"\\nRepresents a company on the TechTalent platform.\\n\\"\\"\\"\\ntype Company implements Node & Timestamped {\\n  \\"\\"\\"\\n  Unique identifier for the company.\\n  \\"\\"\\"\\n  id: ID!\\n\\n  \\"\\"\\"\\n  The name of the company.\\n  \\"\\"\\"\\n  name: String!\\n\\n  # ... other fields\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGood documentation helps both your team and API consumers understand the purpose and usage of each type and field.\\n\\n## Visualizing the Schema\\n\\nTo better understand the relationships in our schema, let\'s visualize the core types:\\n\\n![Diagram Illustrating Relationships between various types ](../static/images/blog/entity-relationships.png)\\n\\nThis diagram illustrates the key relationships between our main entities, helping us ensure our schema accurately represents our domain.\\n\\nTo visualize your schema, you can use tools like [GraphQL Voyager](https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/).\\n\\n## Best Practices and Considerations\\n\\nAs we\'ve designed our schema, we\'ve touched on several best practices. Let\'s recap some key points and add a few more considerations:\\n\\n1. **Start with the UI in mind**: Design your schema based on how the data will be used in your UI, not just how it\'s stored in your database.\\n\\n2. **Use clear, consistent naming**: Adopt a naming convention (e.g., PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields) and stick to it.\\n\\n3. **Leverage GraphQL features**: Make use of enums, interfaces, and unions to create a rich, expressive schema.\\n\\n4. **Plan for change**: Use input types for mutations and consider versioning strategies for evolving your schema over time.\\n\\n5. **Optimize for performance**: Be mindful of N+1 query problems and consider implementing DataLoader or similar batching mechanisms.\\n\\n6. **Secure your schema**: Implement proper authentication and authorization. Consider using directives for field-level permissions.\\n\\n7. **Validate input**: Use non-nullable fields and custom scalars to enforce data integrity at the schema level.\\n\\n8. **Provide meaningful errors**: Return detailed error information in your mutation payloads to help clients handle failures gracefully.\\n\\n9. **Monitor and analyze**: Implement logging and monitoring to understand how your schema is being used and where optimizations can be made.\\n\\n10. **Keep it DRY**: Use interfaces and abstract types to reduce duplication in your schema.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDesigning a production-grade GraphQL schema is an iterative process that requires careful thought and planning. By starting with core types and relationships, then gradually adding queries, mutations, and advanced features, we can build a schema that\'s both powerful and maintainable.\\n\\nRemember, your schema is a living document. As your application evolves, so too will your schema. By following these principles and best practices, you\'ll be well-equipped to design and maintain a GraphQL schema that can grow with your needs.\\n\\nThe TechTalent example we\'ve explored here demonstrates many real-world considerations, but every application will have its unique requirements. Always design with your specific use cases in mind, and don\'t be afraid to iterate as you learn more about how your API is used in practice.\\n\\nBy investing time in thoughtful schema design upfront, you\'ll create a solid foundation for your GraphQL API, enabling efficient development and a great experience for your API consumers.\\n\\nAlright greatttt!

Today, the process is often fraught with complexity, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and reliability issues. Yet again, we had a developer expressing [frustration](https://bessey.dev/blog/2024/05/24/why-im-over-graphql/) about the issues with GraphQL and the reasons for leaving our mighty ship. I wish to dive deeper into these challenges and explore why the future points towards automated, high-performance solutions.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<head>\\n<link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/writing-a-graphql-backend-by-hand-is-long-gone\\"/>\\n<title>Writing a GraphQL Backend by Hand is Long Gone</title>\\n</head>\\n\\n## Complexity with GraphQL\\n\\nIf you see, most of the concerns with GraphQL are around building a robust GraphQL backend. It\'s rarely about consuming GraphQL, because if you look closely at the GraphQL spec, you will find that it\'s focused on how to elegantly consume data. As long as the output of your backend matches what\'s expected in the query, the specification doesn\'t care about how the backend is implemented.\\n\\nHence, the main complexity with GraphQL comes with how GraphQL is built. One of the major hurdles in hand-coding a GraphQL backend is managing performance. Issues like batching, incorrect usage of data loaders, caching, and the notorious N+1 problem can cripple your application.\\n\\nManually implementing batching mechanisms and data loaders can be incredibly tedious. While libraries like [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) can assist, integrating them seamlessly into your system requires a deep understanding of both your data and the GraphQL query patterns. Overuse of data loaders is so common with most GraphQL implementations that ultimately it becomes the main culprit for high latency.\\n\\nSecondly, traditional caching doesn\'t work with GraphQL, so you have to resort to all sorts of solutions, using persisted queries or some vendor-specific implementation of caching. Implementing effective caching strategies is essential for performance but it\'s tricky. Developers must decide what to cache, when to invalidate the cache, and how to manage cache consistency, which adds another layer of complexity.\\n\\nThe N+1 issue, boy, that\'s perhaps everyone\'s favorite issue with GraphQL. It arises when executing multiple upstream requests that could have been combined into one, leading to massive performance degradation. Detecting and solving this requires meticulous analysis of query patterns and database access, which requires developers to have the context of the whole query at once, generate a query plan, translate it to appropriate upstream calls, and then execute! That\'s a lot of complex engineering effort; building a general-purpose query engine is not for the faint-hearted, and in the midst of all this complex yet interesting work, I need to ship features!\\n\\n> [Grafast](https://grafast.org/grafast) is an upcoming generalized query planner that could make query-planning in JS a bit more tamed.\\n\\nGraphQL\u2019s flexibility can be a double-edged sword when it comes to security, necessitating robust mechanisms for authentication and authorization. Like caching, traditional route-based API access doesn\'t work with GraphQL. Implementing these security layers correctly involves ensuring that only authenticated users can access the GraphQL entity and that they can only access data or fields that they are authorized to see. This requires fine-grained control and often custom logic and the invention of a new standard that works just for you.\\n\\nLastly, but most importantly, ensuring your GraphQL API is reliable means tackling error handling, propagation, and telemetry. Proper error handling in GraphQL is crucial for providing meaningful feedback to clients and maintaining the integrity of your application. The GraphQL team recently started working on a [standard](https://graphql-http.com/) for serving GraphQL over HTTP, which won\'t be easy to integrate if you already have a GraphQL API running in production. Moreover, integrating telemetry within a GraphQL backend isn\'t easy either; it is a very involved process to integrate spans to trace GraphQL resolvers. And, if you have written your GraphQL layer by hand in JavaScript, be ready for some [significant performance degradation](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-js/issues/1095).\\n\\n## GraphQL is more like SQL and less like REST\\n\\nWe talked about it in our [previous](graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc-2024-03-30.md) blog why GraphQL isn\'t like REST or gRPC. I would argue that SQL is a closer elder sibling of GraphQL than REST or gRPC. Writing a GraphQL backend can be likened to building an SQL engine manually. Imagine if every time you wanted to interact with a database, you had to write the SQL engine from scratch. Every time you made a database change, you would need to rewrite your engine so that it can work with the new schema or indexes. It\u2019s inefficient and impractical; no one does that. Fortunately, modern databases come with embedded, high-performance SQL engines such as [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) that adhere to the SQL specification but abstract away the complexities around building it. These databases allow developers to focus on writing queries and managing data without worrying about the underlying mechanics, thanks to their sophisticated query engines.\\n\\nGraphQL, much like SQL, is a query language designed to allow clients to request exactly the data they need. Unlike REST, which relies on fixed endpoints, or gRPC, which focuses on remote procedure calls, GraphQL provides a flexible, hierarchical way to fetch and manipulate data, making it a closer analog to SQL in terms of expressiveness and precision. And I believe the future of GraphQL is going to be like the journey of this elder sibling.\\n\\n## The future of GraphQL\\n\\nThe future of GraphQL development is moving towards generalized automated solutions built on modern, low-level system stacks like Rust and Zig, and moving away from the prevalent hand-written Node.js-based solutions of today.\\n\\n[![Most common GraphQL implementations](../static/images/blog/graphql-stack.png)](https://hygraph.com/graphql-survey-2024#how-developers-build-graphql-apis)\\n\\n- These engines will connect to data sources of any type and build a GraphQL endpoint on top of them. They will find connections between other data sources, sometimes completely automatically and sometimes using hints given by the developer, creating a unified GraphQL experience.\\n\\n- Similar to SQL engines, which use JIT techniques to identify performance optimizations at runtime, GraphQL engines will become extremely smart about performance. My hope is that GraphQL will eventually move away from its dependency on the JSON protocol, into something more efficient such as protobuf.\\n\\n- There is definitely going to be a lot of work put into the standardization of the loose ends. GraphQL engines will eventually converge on error handling and error propagation strategies. GraphQL on HTTP is the first step in that direction. Authentication and Authorization too will very quickly become standard features of GraphQL, so you won\'t need to worry about inventing a new way of authentication. This will all be packed into a GraphQL standard. This might be a stretch, but if the standards team gets together, I think even GraphQL caching will be consistent across all GraphQL engines, and you will be able to switch from one caching solution to another without locking into a vendor-specific implementation.\\n\\nYou might have already seen a wave of open-source solutions that build GraphQL on top of existing data sources. One such solution paving the way is [Tailcall](https://tailcall.run). Tailcall\u2019s platform is designed to automate the creation, validation, and optimization of GraphQL backends. Sticking to standards and ensuring developers don\'t ever have to pay the heavy tax of using GraphQL that they do today, do check it out!\\n\\nLastly, if you are reading this today and thinking of writing a GraphQL server by hand, I urge you to reconsider and use something that does this for you. Before you know it, your handwritten solution will be deprecated in favor of something faster, easier, and more secure: an automatic GraphQL solution."},{"id":"graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc","source":"@site/blog/graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc-2024-03-30.md","title":"GraphQL vs REST vs gRPC - an unfair comparison","description":"Understand what makes GraphQL different from REST and gRPC.","date":"2024-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.815,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Mathur","title":"CEO @ Tailcall | Love to talk about programming, scale, distributed systems and building high performance systems.","url":"https://github.com/tusharmath","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=5"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"GraphQL vs REST vs gRPC - an unfair comparison","authors":[{"name":"Tushar Mathur","title":"CEO @ Tailcall | Love to talk about programming, scale, distributed systems and building high performance systems.","url":"https://github.com/tusharmath","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=5","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=5"}],"description":"Understand what makes GraphQL different from REST and gRPC.","image":"/images/blog/gql-vs-rest-vs-grpc-cover.png","hide_table_of_contents":true,"slug":"graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc","canonical_url":"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Writing a GraphQL Backend by Hand is Long Gone","permalink":"/blog/writing-a-graphql-backend-by-hand-is-long-gone"},"nextItem":{"title":"GraphQL Conf 2023","permalink":"/blog/graphql-conf-2023"}},"content":"<head>\\n<link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/graphql-vs-rest-vs-grpc\\"/>\\n<title>GraphQL vs REST vs gRPC - an unfair comparison</title>\\n</head>\\n\\nSince its inception, GraphQL has steadily gained popularity, often finding itself at the center of comparisons with other data query and manipulation languages such as REST and gRPC. The internet is replete with articles debating the merits and demerits of each, with some even questioning the viability of GraphQL. However, this discourse misses a crucial point: the unique strengths of GraphQL. This article aims to illuminate the distinct advantages GraphQL offers, particularly in addressing a common but complex challenge known as impedance mismatch.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nImpedance mismatch refers to the discordance between the capabilities of an existing API and the ideal features required for a specific use case. From the perspective of a platform engineer, the goal is to develop APIs that cater to a broad range of needs. Yet, crafting a unique API for every conceivable requirement is neither practical nor efficient. Consequently, engineers often end up creating generalized APIs. However, as a consumer, you might find these APIs lacking in some respects while being superfluous in others. Furthermore, as your needs evolve, so does your notion of the ideal API, exacerbating this mismatch. Herein lies the brilliance of GraphQL: it offers a framework for structuring data exposure and queries that significantly mitigates this issue.\\n\\nThe GraphQL specification introduces the concept of viewing data as a graph composed of nodes, which represent domain entities for a business, interconnected by relationships that define their interactions. For instance, in the development of a social network, a user entity might have the ability to create a post, which in turn could receive comments, illustrating the interconnected nature of data entities.\\n![Image Demonstrating a graph of entities](../static/images/blog/entity-graph.png)\\n\\nWith the data conceptualized as a graph, GraphQL advocates for a method of querying that allows for precise data retrieval. This selective querying capability enables developers to request exactly the data they need, distinguishing GraphQL from REST and gRPC which aren\'t truly a \\"queryable\\". The precision of GraphQL extends to the granularity of specifying individual fields within entities, facilitating extremely efficient and targeted queries.\\n![Image Demonstrating a relations between entities](../static/images/blog/entity-relation.png)\\n\\nNotably, the GraphQL specification does not prescribe any specific data storage methodologies but focuses on the manner in which data is queried, hence the designation \\"Graph Query Language.\\" This approach allows for queries tailored to specific requirements, such as obtaining posts by the current user along with comments on those posts. By enabling precise data queries, GraphQL helps in avoiding the inefficiencies associated with over-fetching or under-fetching data, thereby enhancing overall system performance.\\n\\nThe impedance mismatch is not solely a technical issue pertaining to the differences in API schemas. It extends into the realm of development processes as well. GraphQL significantly ameliorates this aspect by allowing the consumers of an API to begin their work even before the actual API is fully implemented. This is made possible through the agreement on a schema upfront. By decoupling the dependency between the consumer and the provider of the API, GraphQL facilitates a more efficient and flexible development process.\\n\\nComparing GraphQL with REST or gRPC on this front might not do justice to their distinct objectives. REST and gRPC are primarily designed as lightweight RPC protocols, not specifically to address impedance mismatch for which a full fledged query language is more suitable. A more apt comparison would be with OpenAPI, which also allows for API composition. However, OpenAPI\'s capabilities in fine-tuning what an API delivers are somewhat [constrained](https://swagger.io/specification/#composition-and-inheritance-polymorphism) compared to GraphQL\'s flexible querying capabilities.\\n\\nBeyond the technical resolution of impedance mismatch, GraphQL addresses a critical business problem: the inefficiency in software development that arises from this gap between actual and ideal APIs. This inefficiency leads to developers spending excessive time on API orchestration\u2014time that could be better spent on core application development. They find themselves constantly writing, revising, and optimizing APIs and their orchestration, as well as managing the fallout from breaking changes. By leveraging GraphQL, developers can significantly reduce these frictions, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity. In essence, GraphQL not only solves a technical problem but also delivers substantial business value by enabling more efficient and flexible software development practices.\\n\\nGraphQL offers an excellent developer experience for API consumption with its intuitive query language that allows for retrieving deeply nested data independently of the upstream source. However, it does have some limitations.

However, they may not always be the silver bullet they appear to be. This post delves into the concept of persisted queries (PQ) and automatic persisted queries (APQ), highlighting the limitations and potential scaling issues that accompany these technologies.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n<head>\\n<link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/the-truth-about-scaling-automatic-persisted-queries\\"/>\\n<title>The truth about scaling Automatic Persisted Queries</title>\\n</head>\\n### The Problem\\n\\n#### Large Queries\\n\\nClients send queries to a GraphQL server as HTTP requests that include the query as the body. When these queries become large, they can lead to increased latency and network usage, degrading client performance.\\n\\nFor example, a normal GraphQL query might look like this:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST -H \\"Content-Type: application/json\\" \\\\\\n  --data \'{\\"query\\": \\"{ largeQuery { field1 field2 ... } }\\"}\' \\\\\\n  http://your-graphql-server.com/graphql\\n```\\n\\nEach GraphQL query is parsed every time the server receives it. If it\'s large, the parsing can take a significant amount of time, increasing latency even further.\\n\\n#### Legacy Infrastructure\\n\\nExisting CDN infrastructure is designed to cache only GET calls. To make a GraphQL request, one must make a POST call. This limits the usage of CDNs for caching purposes.\\n\\n### Solution: Persisted Queries (PQ)\\n\\n#### Definition and Benefits\\n\\nTo enhance network performance for large query strings, GraphQL server supports Persisted Queries (PQ). A PQ is a GraphQL query cached server-side, identified by its SHA-256 hash. Clients send this identifier instead of the query, dramatically reducing request sizes (without affecting response), saving parsing time, and enabling GET calls instead of POST.\\n\\nA PQ request might look like this:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -X GET -H \\"Content-Type: application/json\\" \\\\\\n  --data-urlencode \'extensions={\\"persistedQuery\\":{\\"version\\":1,\\"sha256Hash\\":\\"<SHA 256>\\"}}\' \\\\\\n  http://your-graphql-server.com/graphql\\n```\\n\\n#### Application with CDNs\\n\\nUsing the PQ link automatically sends short hashed queries as GET requests, enabling CDNs to serve them.\\n\\n##### **Latency Reduction**\\n\\n- **No Parsing Overhead**: Since the query isn\'t sent to the server, the parsing stage, which can be computationally expensive, is eliminated. This saves valuable server processing time, directly reducing client latency.\\n\\n- **Network Efficiency**: By transmitting only the hash instead of the full query, the request size is dramatically reduced, leading to faster network transmission and lower latency.\\n\\n##### **Security Enhancements**\\n\\n- **Control Over Allowed Queries**: The server can start with a finite set of \\"allowed\\" queries, ensuring that unauthorized or unoptimized GraphQL requests cannot be made. This control is a significant safeguard for production environments, preventing potential abuse or inefficiencies.\\n\\n- **Reduction in Attack Surface**: By limiting the queries to a pre-defined set, the risk of malicious queries is reduced, enhancing the security profile of the application.\\n\\n#### Problem\\n\\nWhile PQs provide remarkable benefits, they are not without challenges:\\n\\n- **Schema Rigidity**: If you aim to keep the schema open and queries dynamic, supporting any possible query becomes complex.\\n\\n- **Maintenance of Cached Queries**: Managing the cache of allowed queries and keeping them in sync with evolving client needs can become a maintenance burden, especially in a fast-changing environment.\\n\\n### Automatic Persisted Queries (APQs)\\n\\n#### APQs vs PQs\\n\\nAPQs are a supposed improvement over PQs. In a PQ setup, the server runs with a known set of queries, meaning client changes require server updates. This has implications for maintenance costs, particularly in supporting multiple versions of queries and making a server deployment for every change in the client query. APQs were introduced to overcome these challenges.\\n\\n#### How APQs Work\\n\\nThe APQ process is a two-step approach:\\n\\n1. **Hash Request**: The client sends a request with the hash of the query. If the server recognizes the hash, it returns the corresponding response:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -X GET -H \\"Content-Type: application/json\\" \\\\\\n     --data-urlencode \'extensions={\\"persistedQuery\\":{\\"version\\":1,\\"sha256Hash\\":\\"<SHA 256>\\"}}\' \\\\\\n     http://your-graphql-server.com/graphql\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Full Query Request**: If the server does not recognize the hash, it returns an error. The client then sends a new request that includes both the hash and the full query string:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   curl --get http://localhost:4000/graphql \\\\\\n     --header \'content-type: application/json\' \\\\\\n     --data-urlencode \'{\\"query\\": \\"{ largeQuery { field1 field2 ... } }\\"}\' \\\\\\n     --data-urlencode \'extensions={\\"persistedQuery\\":{\\"version\\":1,\\"sha256Hash\\":\\"<HASH>\\"}}\'\\n   ```\\n\\n   The server parses the full query, caches it for future use, and returns the GraphQL response. Subsequent requests use the hash.\\n\\nThis process optimizes network performance while allowing flexibility in the queries that can be run. You can read more about APQ [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)\\n\\n### Problems with APQs\\n\\n#### Thundering Herd Problem\\n\\nConsider a situation where a server has just been deployed or restarted, and the cache is empty. Now, multiple clients send hash requests for queries that are not yet cached.\\n\\n1. **Massive Error Responses**: Since the cache is empty, the server returns errors for all hash requests, signaling the clients to send the full query strings.\\n\\n2. **Simultaneous Full Query Requests**: All clients now simultaneously send full query requests, causing a sudden surge in demand.\\n\\n3. **Server Strain**: The server must parse and cache each unique query, placing significant strain on its resources. This can lead to increased latency and even server failure if the demand is too high.\\n\\n4. **Repeated Pattern**: If the server struggles to cache the queries quickly enough, the clients may continue to receive errors and retry the full query requests, perpetuating the problem.\\n\\nIn an environment with many clients and dynamically changing queries, the system can become vulnerable to sudden surges in demand. This vulnerability can undermine the performance benefits APQs are designed to provide, leading to potential system instability.\\n\\n#### Cache Limitations\\n\\nQueries are typically cached in memory, requiring cache warmup on each instance, hindering deployment on server-less solutions. An alternative could be using a centralized cache, but it typically nullifies performance gains due to serialization, deserialization, and IO call overhead.\\n\\n#### Security Concerns\\n\\nAutomatically persisting queries can cause memory leaks, as clients can send varying query combinations, exhausting server memory. Mitigation through cache size limits and eviction mechanisms may lead to frequent cache misses, leading to doubling request numbers.\\n\\n### Possible Solution\\n\\nPersistent queries are a great improvement over regular queries. They clearly improve performance and are more secure. APQs on the other hand though try to give more flexibility they can become quite messy to deal with as you scale. One alternative that is significantly more effective, is to run GraphQL on Edge itself. Essentially write your own CDN layer that is smart enough to understand that it\'s a graphQL and deploy it on edge with caching and whatnot! This is hard, and that\'s exactly what [Tailcall](https://tailcall.run) helps solve.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nAutomatic persisted queries, while offering some advantages in network performance, reveal significant challenges when it comes to scaling. The complexities of caching, potential security risks, and the inherent problems with automatic persistence highlight that persisted queries may not be the one-size-fits-all solution they are often portrayed as.\\n\\nThe question of whether to implement PQ or APQ must be approached with caution, taking into account the specific requirements and potential scalability issues of your system. While they may serve as a useful tool in certain scenarios, understanding the limitations and conducting thorough analysis is vital to avoid falling into the trap of a solution that doesn\'t truly scale. This blog post has aimed to shed light on these complexities, encouraging a more nuanced perspective on a topic that is often oversimplified."},{"id":"unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation","source":"@site/blog/bff-challenges-2023-06-19.md","title":"Unraveling the Challenges of BFF Federation","description":"A different take on GraphQL Federation.","date":"2023-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":10.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Mathur","title":"CEO @ Tailcall | Love to talk about programming, scale, distributed systems and building high performance systems.","url":"https://github.com/tusharmath","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Unraveling the Challenges of BFF Federation","subtitle":"A different take on GraphQL Federation.","authors":[{"name":"Tushar Mathur","title":"CEO @ Tailcall | Love to talk about programming, scale, distributed systems and building high performance systems.","url":"https://github.com/tusharmath","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4"}],"description":"A different take on GraphQL Federation.","image":"/images/blog/bff-cover.png","hide_table_of_contents":true,"slug":"unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation","canonical_url":"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The truth about scaling Automatic Persisted Queries","permalink":"/blog/the-truth-about-scaling-automatic-persisted-queries"},"nextItem":{"title":"No one talks about API Orchestration","permalink":"/blog/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration"}},"content":"In our [previous](https://blog.tailcall.run/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration) blog post, we discussed the challenges of API Orchestration and its often overlooked role in a microservices architecture. We explored how, while it serves as an abstraction for frontend apps and websites, this abstraction\'s performance is very sensitive to network latency and device performance thus directly impacting end-user experience. One proposed solution was to create a Backend for Frontend (BFF) layer, essentially moving the frontend abstraction to powerful servers within your VPC. Although this approach effectively addresses the user experience problem and simplifies the work of front-end engineers, it introduces a new set of challenges for the backend, leading to difficulties in scaling the monolithic solution. Here\'s what the BFF architecture looked like:\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<head>\\n<link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation\\"/>\\n<title>Unraveling the Challenges of BFF Federation</title>\\n</head>\\n\\n![Architecture Diagram for BFF](../static/images/blog/bff-architecture.png)\\n\\n## Using a BFF Federation\\n\\nFederation, as a concept, is not exclusive to GraphQL. In essence, it\'s about abstracting multiple data sources or services into a unified, single API interface that can be consumed by clients. This approach is not unique to any particular technology or framework and can be implemented with various tools and languages.\\n\\nHowever, GraphQL has played a significant role in popularizing the concept of federation. With its strong typing, introspective capabilities, and its natural fit for defining schemas across distributed services, it has provided an elegant solution to the challenge of federating APIs.\\n\\nWhile this blog discusses federation in the context of GraphQL, it\'s essential to understand that the core principles and challenges of the federation can be applied beyond GraphQL. Remember, the implementation of federation is not about a specific technology, but about the architectural approach to create a unified interface from multiple data sources.\\n\\nWith this in mind, let\'s delve into the pros and cons of the federation, using GraphQL as our main context for the discussion. As you\'ll see, the benefits and pitfalls of federation are relevant, whether you\'re using GraphQL or not.\\n\\nFederation is a concept that originates from the philosophy of microservices. This approach promotes the partitioning of large monolithic systems into smaller, more manageable components. In a federated architecture, instead of having a monolithic Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) handling all requests, you have multiple smaller BFFs that handle different aspects of the request.\\n\\nImagine a client makes a request to your system. This request still goes through an API gateway, which serves as the entry point to your system. However, instead of hitting a monolithic BFF, it now meets a BFF Router, specifically designed to understand and route requests to the appropriate BFFs.\\n\\nThe Router is smart. It understands the client\'s request and can break it down into smaller parts. It then delegates these smaller tasks to the appropriate services, each responsible for a specific aspect of the request. These services work in parallel, handling their part of the request, which often involves calling downstream microservices and orchestrating their responses.\\n\\nOnce the BFFs have finished their tasks, they send their responses back to the Router. The Router, in turn, takes these individual responses, combines them into a single response that fulfils the original request, and sends it back to the client.\\n\\nThis system, where individual services handle specific parts of a request in a coordinated manner, is often referred to as a Federation. The term \\"Apollo Federation\\" or \\"Super Graph\\" is commonly used to describe this setup when it\'s implemented with Apollo, a popular GraphQL implementation, but the concept is not limited to any specific technology or tool.\\n\\n![BFF Federation Architecture](../static/images/blog/bff-federation.png)\\n\\n## Federation Benefits\\n\\nMany large organizations using GraphQL in production have transitioned to this architecture to accommodate their scaling needs. The primary selling points of this architecture are:\\n\\n1. **Enhanced Team Ownership**: GraphQL Federation fosters a sense of ownership among teams by allowing each team to own and maintain its GraphQL service. With Federation, teams can operate independently, focusing on their specific domain without worrying about the overall schema. This separation of concerns leads to more maintainable code, faster development cycles, and increased productivity. It empowers teams to work in parallel, each owning a piece of the larger schema while ensuring that the entire system operates as a cohesive whole. This significantly enhances team efficiency and collaboration, particularly in larger organizations with multiple teams working on different services. This alone is by far the most significant aspect of using GraphQL Federation.\\n\\n2. **Incremental Adoption**: A major advantage of GraphQL Federation is its ability to support incremental adoption. This means teams can gradually wrap their domain-specific microservices with a GraphQL layer, one at a time, and integrate it into the federated schema without disrupting the entire system. This flexible approach minimizes the impact on existing workflows and reduces the risks associated with large-scale changes.  \\n   From the frontend perspective, GraphQL Federation offers a unified interface for querying the data. This simplifies the frontend code and enables the development of rich, interactive UIs with less effort. As soon as the first services are federated, frontend developers can begin transitioning their queries to the federated schema, reducing disruption and allowing for a smoother adoption process.  \\n   This incremental approach also allows teams to evaluate and demonstrate the value of federation at each step, building confidence and promoting buy-in across the organization. It ensures teams are not overwhelmed by the complexity of new technology or architecture and can adjust their practices as they learn.\\n\\n## Federation vs BFF\\n\\n![BFF vs Federation](../static/images/blog/bff-vs-federation.png)\\n\\nIt\'s not hard to see that GraphQL Federation carries some serious muscle over its monolithic adversary, the BFF. But before we declare a champion, let\'s take a few rounds to scrutinize the [limitations](https://blog.tailcall.run/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration#heading-highly-specialized) we\'ve come across in our BFF solution, and see how the GraphQL Federation stands up under pressure. It\'s time for a head-to-head comparison!\\n\\n1. **Specialization**: Both BFF and GraphQL Federation require a certain amount of manual intervention. In the BFF approach, the entire layer is custom-built, meaning there\'s no ready-to-use solution, which necessitates significant manual management. On the other hand, GraphQL Federation provides an open-source, ready-to-use Apollo Router. However, it\'s not an all-inclusive solution, as the individual GraphQL services still need to be manually maintained and written by hand for specific use cases. While it\'s still a tough fight, the federation manages to land a jab here and gets a few extra points in this round.\\n\\n2. **Fragility**: Federation offers an enhanced strategy. In a federated architecture, when a GraphQL service malfunction, only its segment of the graph becomes inaccessible to the user. This results in a more resilient system, less prone to total failure, demonstrating the ability to continue the fight even after taking a hit. In this round, Federation steps up and delivers a solid punch.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: When it comes to Performance, the Federation architecture introduces an extra journey for each packet. The request has to travel through the router, then to the individual GraphQL services, before finally reaching the domain service. This journey can add a few milliseconds of latency, a difference that may not be perceptible to the end user. However, this seemingly small delay has a broader impact on the performance of the entire architecture. The addition of the router introduces a requirement for more infrastructure and increases the frequency of data serialization and deserialization. This increased complexity affects both the system\'s throughput and infrastructure costs. In this round, the Federation architecture might not be the clear knockout winner we were hoping for.\\n\\n4. **Monolith Tendency**: It\'s a clear knockout in this round for the Federation! It elegantly sidesteps the monolith tendency, keeping the architecture agile and modular. BFF, in contrast, takes a heavy fall with its tendency to become a monolithic layer over time.\\n\\n5. **Canary Release:** Federation, unlike BFF, reveals graph dependencies and compatibility issues at runtime, not compile time. This amps up the need for first-class canary releases. However, when it comes to canary support, it\'s a draw. Both fighters are still in the ring, each showing resilience in their own way. No knockout here, folks!\\n\\n6. **Coupled Release**: In the Federation architecture, each GraphQL service operates independently, significantly reducing the coupling between services and the router. This independence allows each team to manage its own release cycles, putting an end to the wide-scale halts that were commonplace with the BFF layer. However, it\'s important to note that each GraphQL service still maintains a tight connection with its corresponding downstream domain service. While this is a form of coupling, it\'s considerably less invasive than the BFF approach, where the entire layer was intertwined. Despite this necessary connection to the domain services, the Federation architecture proves to be more agile. In this round, GraphQL Federation edges out the BFF approach.\\n\\n7. **Organizational Friction:** With Federation, the responsibility for managing the architecture often falls squarely on the shoulders of backend engineers. The reason is simple: the complexity of the architecture and its intimate ties with downstream domain services necessitate a deep level of technical understanding. This is a departure from the BFF paradigm, where frontend teams could claim ownership of this part of the infrastructure. The intricate nature of the Federation, however, makes this almost untenable. When put head-to-head with BFFs, the Federation seems to take a step back in this regard. The power to control abstraction slips away from the consumer. In this round, BFFs manage to hold their ground.\\n\\n8. **Legacy Gateway:** Just as in the BFF model, the API gateway maintains its place in the Federation architecture, and rightfully so. However, we find ourselves reestablishing a substantial amount of resiliency and caching logic within these new layers, duplicating efforts previously expended on a traditional gateway. This redundancy marks a lack of efficiency in the Federation approach, signaling a tie in this round.\\n\\nOverall, this round favors GraphQL Federation. It proves to be a significantly more robust architecture when evaluated based on the aforementioned criteria. Let\'s explore further and assess how it performs in isolation and as the company expands.\\n\\n## Pitfalls of GraphQL Federation\\n\\nWhile GraphQL Federation has numerous benefits, it is not without its downsides. Here are some points of caution that should be considered when deciding to use this architecture:\\n\\n1. **Cost and Complexity:** GraphQL Federation introduces significant complexity into the architecture. Setting up, maintaining, and testing a federated graph can be a challenge as it requires a deep understanding of both GraphQL and distributed systems. Additionally, this architecture demands more infrastructure and a larger team for maintenance. As such, the adoption and migration process can be complex and costly. Typically, only large organizations with platform teams, robust budgets, and a governing body to maintain the schema\'s sanctity and system reliability, tend to consider adopting this approach. The inherent complexity and cost implications make the Federation a less likely choice for small to medium-sized organizations.\\n\\n2. **Ownership Challenges:** It is often argued that domain service owners maintain their individual GraphQL layers. However, this doesn\'t always reflect the reality. Services can frequently be divided or merged, leading to uncertainty about how to modify the GraphQL layer. This results in a complex web of requests from GraphQL services to domain services outside the team\'s control.\\n\\n3. **Infrastructure Scaling:** Each subgraph in a federated architecture operates on a separate piece of infrastructure, scaling independently. This brings its own set of challenges. For instance, when a subgraph is divided or merged, computing and scaling requirements need to be re-evaluated. Moreover, a deployment in another subgraph can trigger a substantial increase in load from the router on your subgraph, potentially causing unexpected stress on your infrastructure. This underscores the need for robust scaling and load-balancing strategies within a federated architecture.\\n\\nWhile GraphQL Federation has the potential to solve some issues of traditional BFF architecture, it brings in its own set of challenges. Therefore, it\'s important to evaluate these considerations based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project before deciding to implement this architecture.\\n\\n## We are onto something\\n\\nWhen examining the underlying issue, the debate essentially revolves around microservices and monoliths. Undoubtedly, the federated solution offers better scalability compared to a monolithic architecture; however, it also introduces a myriad of distinct challenges related to maintenance and costs that warrant careful consideration. This is not the end of the discussion, as client requests pass through CDNs and the Gateway before reaching the router, and we have yet to explore those components of the infrastructure. In the following sections, we will delve into these components and further investigate how they interact, as well as delve deeper into GraphQL."},{"id":"no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration","source":"@site/blog/api-orchestration-2023-06-12.md","title":"No one talks about API Orchestration","description":"A Forsaken Piece Of Every Microservice Architecture","date":"2023-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":10.23,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Mathur","title":"CEO @ Tailcall | Love to talk about programming, scale, distributed systems and building high performance systems.","url":"https://github.com/tusharmath","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"No one talks about API Orchestration","subtitle":"A Forsaken Piece Of Every Microservice Architecture.","authors":[{"name":"Tushar Mathur","title":"CEO @ Tailcall | Love to talk about programming, scale, distributed systems and building high performance systems.","url":"https://github.com/tusharmath","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194482?v=4"}],"description":"A Forsaken Piece Of Every Microservice Architecture","image":"/images/blog/bff-architecture.png","hide_table_of_contents":true,"slug":"no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration","canonical_url":"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Unraveling the Challenges of BFF Federation","permalink":"/blog/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<head>\\n<link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://tailcall.hashnode.dev/no-one-talks-about-api-orchestration\\"/>\\n<title>No one talks about API Orchestration</title>\\n</head>\\n\\nBeing in the industry for many years, building and consuming microservices, I have realized that there is one problem that no one really talks about when it comes to microservices ie. API Orchestration. As engineers, we love our microservices, small independent components that are responsible for doing just one thing. The promise that was sold when I was a kid was you can build these small independent services and compose them together to build an app, very fast and reliably. It took me years to realize that the necessary tooling for \\"composing\\" just doesn\'t exist! There are tools for distributed tracing, observability, caching, discovery, etc. But to compose services to build a product is completely offloaded to front-end engineers! There were two things that were happening in the tech ecosystem:\\n\\n1. **Rich User Interfaces:** Responsive websites that worked on desktop and mobile are dead. To build a successful B2C business, you need to build for all three platforms viz. Android, iOS, and Web (Desktop/PWA). The applications need to look slick, rich in information, and have snappy response times. Development on multiple platforms requires a nuanced understanding of the stack and a lot of duplication of code.\\n\\n2. **Microservice Proliferation:** Companies these days bootstrap themselves on microservices instead of monoliths. This is because the tooling to build microservices has gotten a lot better, and reusable components are available either in open-source or as a SAAS solution. This allows developers to focus on their core business logic and move fast.\\n\\n## Microservice\\n\\nMicroservices architecture is a design pattern in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services, each of which runs its process and communicates with other services through well-defined interfaces, typically using a lightweight messaging protocol. This approach has several benefits over a monolithic architecture, including improved scalability, resilience, and maintainability. In a microservices architecture, each service has a specific role and is independently deployable, so developers can work on different services in parallel and deploy them independently of each other. This can make the development process more agile and allow for faster deployment of new features.\\n\\n![Microservices Architecture](../static/images/blog/microservices-architecture.png)\\n\\nAn API gateway is a server that acts as a single point of entry for certain types of requests. It can receive requests from the client, route them to the appropriate backend service, and then return the response from the backend service to the client. An API gateway can also perform tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching. This makes it a useful component in a microservices architecture, where each service has its API and the API gateway acts as the \\"front door\\" for clients to access the services.\\n\\n## API Composition\\n\\nAPI composition refers to the process of combining multiple APIs to create a new API or a new functionality. This can be done by sending requests to multiple APIs and combining the results, or by creating a new API that acts as a fa\xe7ade for the underlying APIs.\\n\\n> \ud83d\udca1 API Composition is also known as API Orchestration. This is however vastly different from Microservice Orchestration.\\n\\nFor example, consider a scenario where a client application wants to display a user\'s profile information and recent posts on a social media platform. In this case, the client can send two separate requests to two different APIs: one to retrieve the user\'s profile information, and another to retrieve their recent posts. The client can then combine the results from these two APIs to create a single response that contains all the required information. This new response can be considered as the output of the composed API.\\n\\nTo build a rich user interface, API composition is necessary on the client side. One of the main challenges with API composition on the client side is that it can lead to increased complexity in the client application. This is because the client needs to handle the process of sending requests to multiple APIs and combining the results, which can add to the overall size and complexity of the client code.\\n\\nAnother challenge with API composition on the client side is that it can result in reduced performance and increased latency. This is because the client needs to make multiple separate requests to different APIs, which can take more time and result in a slower response from the composed API.\\n\\nIn addition, API composition on the client side can also lead to increased security risks. This is because the client needs to handle sensitive information, such as API keys and authentication credentials, which can be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured. The client doesn\'t have access to powerful CPUs or a reliable network either. This makes the composition problem even more challenging to implement and manage. It is therefore often more efficient and effective to perform API composition on the server side instead.\\n\\n## Backend For Frontend\\n\\nA BFF layer can help to solve the challenges of API composition by providing a separate backend service that is optimized for each specific frontend client. This can enable the BFF to perform API composition on behalf of the client, which can help to improve the performance and reliability of the composed API. The BFF layer typically sits as a separate component in the overall architecture, between the frontend client and the microservices. It can communicate with both the frontend client and the microservices using well-defined interfaces and protocols, such as REST or gRPC.\\n\\nThe BFF can take advantage of a powerful CPU and access to a fast network to improve the performance and reliability of the composed API. It can also provide added flexibility and control over the composition process. This can make it a useful tool for developers who want to create new APIs by combining the functionality of multiple underlying APIs.\\n\\n![BFF Architecture](../static/images/blog/bff-architecture.png)\\n\\nBFFs truly solve the problems mentioned above to a great extent, however they introduce new set of challenges viz.\\n\\n### Highly Specialized\\n\\nOne of the challenges with using a BFF layer is that it is a highly specialized solution that requires a significant amount of hand-written code. Unlike an API gateway, there is no standard BFF solution that can be deployed out-of-the-box, and each BFF implementation must be custom-tailored to the specific requirements of the frontend client. This lack of standardization and reusability can make the BFF solution more complex and difficult to maintain.\\n\\n### Fragile\\n\\nAnother challenge with using a BFF layer is that it can be fragile and susceptible to failure. The BFF solution is dependent on the developers to follow best practices and handle all error scenarios, and if these steps are not taken, the solution can be prone to bugs and performance issues. Additionally, the BFF solution must be thoroughly tested, including performance testing, unit testing, and integration testing, to ensure that it is reliable and performs well in production. This can require significant effort and expertise, and if these steps are not properly followed, the BFF solution can be fragile and prone to failure. Also, it\'s worth mentioning that a BFF layer is an entry point to all your backend, it going down basically means nothing is accessible for the user so this layer needs to be robust and resilient to exceptions.\\n\\n### Performance\\n\\nBecause BFF layers are typically custom-written for each use case, it can be difficult to predict the performance impact of a small code change. Issues such as unoptimized algorithms, inefficient caching, and unnecessary downstream requests can go unnoticed and only be discovered very late in the development cycle. Typically companies perform thorough benchmarking and load testing before anything goes live. This results in a very high time to market even for minor changes.\\n\\n### Monolith\\n\\nEventually, this layer turns out to be a big monolith touching every service in your backend. The layer contains a lot of handwritten spaghetti code that\'s hard to maintain. Onboarding new engineers also becomes harder and upgrading libraries or architecture gets costlier. Any tiny change requires a full-fledged deployment on your infrastructure.\\n\\n### Canary Support (or lack thereof)\\n\\nEvery change that happens in the backend requires the deployment of the BFF layer. In fact, any feature that is built on the client also requires changes on the BFF layer. Such frequent changes can not be exposed to 100% of users because the reliability and performance of this system are unknown. A common way to solve this problem is to use [blue-green](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment) deployments. This requires additional infrastructure and complex routing mechanisms. First-class support to do canary releases is very important and should be part of a modern BFF layer, however, most companies rely on DevOps for its support.\\n\\n### Coupled Release\\n\\nBFF layers can\'t be deployed independently since they act as a bridge between the clients and the services. Generally, the services need to go live first, and they need to make sure that the change is compatible with the current version of the BFF layer running in production. The interesting problem is in case there is a bug in the microservice and it needs to be reverted, even the BFF layer needs to be reverted. This kind of coupling makes it operationally very expensive to manage.\\n\\n### Organizational Friction\\n\\nThe Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern is designed to create a tailor-made backend service for each user interface (e.g., desktop, mobile, etc.), with the aim of simplifying the client-side and improving the user experience.\\n\\nHowever, in practice, this architecture sometimes creates friction within the organization, particularly when BFFs are developed and maintained by the backend team. Here are a few reasons why:\\n\\n1. **Communication and Responsiveness:** As the backend team is typically in charge of the BFF, front-end teams often have to wait for them to make necessary changes. This slows down the development process, especially when backlogs are high or priorities differ.\\n\\n2. **Different Skillsets:** Backend and frontend developers often specialize in different programming languages and paradigms. If the backend team is in charge of the BFF, they might not be as comfortable or efficient at dealing with issues that are more closely related to the frontend.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Ownership:** Frontend teams often feel that they lack ownership and control over the part of the system that directly impacts their work. This leads to decreased motivation and productivity.\\n\\nOne potential solution to these issues is to shift the ownership of the BFFs to the front-end teams. Since these teams are the primary consumers of the BFFs, they could be better placed to design, implement, and maintain them. This would not only empower the front-end teams but also free up backend teams to focus on their core responsibilities.\\n\\nHowever, this solution is not without its own challenges. For one, front-end teams would need to upskill to handle their new responsibilities. Also, the organization would need to ensure that there are clear lines of communication between the front-end and backend teams, so that any changes to shared resources can be coordinated effectively.\\n\\n### Legacy Gateway\\n\\nBFF layers often end up implementing some of the cross-cutting concerns of an API gateway such as rate limiting, authentication, throttling, etc. This makes its purpose quite confusing in the sense that do we need an API gateway if we are using a BFF layer. Moreover, it\'s not very clear if we use an API gateway with a BFF layer, where should we place it? Should we place it between the clients and the BFF layer or the BFF layer and the service mesh? These are subjective decisions that each company ends up making as there is no standard way of doing this. However, it\'s worth mentioning that legacy gateways do introduce a gap that\'s being attempted to be filled by a BFF layer.\\n\\n> BFF, Presentation Layer, Facade, Middleware, UI Layer, Orchestration Layer, API Adapter \u2014 Are all different nomenclatures used for the same thing.\\n\\nTo summarize, BFFs do indeed address the issues of API orchestration to a significant extent; however, they also present a new set of challenges for organizations to tackle. Clearly, there is more to the story. In our [next blog post](https://blog.tailcall.run/unraveling-the-challenges-of-bff-federation), we will discuss some of the solutions that large organizations with unlimited budgets have implemented to overcome this problem.
