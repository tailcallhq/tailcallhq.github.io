Yet, the broader their scope, the more they diverge from being the perfect fit for any specific use case. This fundamental discrepancy \u2014 the impedance mismatch between the general capabilities of an API and the precise needs of a particular scenario \u2014 amplifies the necessity for an orchestration layer. Such a layer adeptly bridges this gap, tailor-fitting generic APIs to meet exact requirements with finesse. Tailcall stands at the forefront of this innovation, seamlessly transforming the way APIs are integrated and interacted with.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting_started/launch":{"id":"getting_started/launch","title":"Launch","description":"Now, run the following command to start the server with the full path to the file that you created earlier.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/cli":{"id":"guides/cli","title":"CLI","description":"The TailCall CLI (Command Line Interface) is an essential part of the TailCall toolkit.

Most of them come by default, and we can also create our own. They store information used by our operating system or other programs. For example, the PATH variable stores a list of directories the operating system searches when we run a command in the terminal.
